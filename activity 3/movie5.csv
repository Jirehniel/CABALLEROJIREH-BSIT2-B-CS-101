"851222","Greetings from Lithuania.I don't watch romantic movies often, but when i heard about story of ""One day"" i thought of giving it a chance. And it sure didn't disappoint me. This is a really good love story, told in a single day in a year in period of 23 years. Movie is beautifully filmed, with great acting by the two leads, especially from Anne Hathaway. She's just so ... beautiful in every meaning of this word. Can't wait to see her next summer in ""TDKR"". ""One day"" isn't your typical Hollywood love story and you can clearly FEEL that watching it. Give this movie a chance and you can be really surprised that when this movie will end, you'll fell your self a little ... brighter.","9","16 October 2011"
"achyutaghosh","Disclaimer first up- biased review, as I am a sucker for love stories.I used to think that Hollywood had stopped making emotionally involving love stories. Thank god they made One Day, then. Based on the best selling book by British author Dave Nicholls, the movie explores the intertwined lives of two protagonists of contrasting nature, yet fated to be together. The premise is novel, with the relationship explored though a peek into 15th July of each year, spread over 22 years. Good stories are brought to life by good acting, and here we have two superb exponents in lead roles- Jim Sturgess as Dexter and Anna Hathaway as Emma. Dexter leads the high profile life, a television anchor with success in all forms chasing him, always. But then his life is also hollow, his friends shallow, and in the end, a faces disillusionment and compromise. Emma dwells in obscurity mostly, but through sheer tenacity and belief achieves a modicum of success as a writer. They meet when they are 18, decide to remain lifelong friends, and they do remain so. In the meanwhile meandering through the vagaries of life, they are inexorably drawn towards each other, dependent on each other.Childhood sweethearts, even if long lost, when they do come together, they do get together without any questions asked- i say this having witnessed the same on a close friend of mine. And you cant help but fall in love with Emma and Dexter- their love story is so compelling and adorable, that you become a part of their story, you care for them, you laugh with them, and also cry, you want them to do what you would do, and yes, you desperately want a happy ending for them.And of course there is Anna Hathaway-suitably rumpled and grunge in the first half, and elegance and grace personified in the second, when she flashes her pearly whites, the world seems to be a better place to live.Why do people in love get to be in love in the best of locations? One Day happens in picturesque Edinburgh, colourful London, and stylish Paris. And the best thing that makes it stand out among all love stories is that it is not predictable, till the very end. People and things change with time, but memories remain the same.- here's a movie that raises a toast to happy memories, a Must watch for mushy folks!","8","23 November 2011"
"Philby-3","One Day Two eighties graduates in Edinburgh have an encounter on graduation day, July 15th ; the film follows their relationship by annual updates. Dexter (Jim Sturgess) brilliant, charismatic and a total narcissist and Emma (Ann Hathaway), a demure, warm sort are not a great match and both hitch up with others, but their friendship endures.The film is romantic, but only to a point, and can hardly be described as a comedy; there is too much pain for that, despite some funny dialogue. It is a kind of growing older movie – early promise turning sour, bright young ambitious things tasting failure and settling for something less. The story is cleverly told and nicely shot, with good support from Ken Stott and Patricia Clarkson as Dexter's disapproving parents and Rhys Spall as Emma's husband. Jim Sturgess looks and acts uncannily like a younger Rupert Graves, who has portrayed a long line of charming handsome wastrels. Ann Hathaway might be from New York but she plays Emma perfectly – the dialect coaches really earned their money. Both of the principals manage to evoke our sympathy, though Sturgess has the harder job.July 15 is St Swithin's day. On that day in 1415 the English Army led by Henry V (alias Laurence Olivier or Kenneth Branagh) defeated a larger French force at Agincourt. This has absolutely nothing to do with the movie though Dexter and Emma do at one stage venture to Brittany, where they manage to lose their clothes in one of the film's more comedic moments.I couldn't help feeling the story arc was rather predictable but I was absorbed nonetheless. At the end I'm not sure what the attraction was for Emma – she was smart enough to realise Dexter was a jerk but somehow she couldn't resist. He does get better – perhaps deep down she wanted to reform him. Or perhaps deep down she wanted to be a bit wild too. A film for generation Xers who are wondering what the hell happened to their youthful dreams and plans.","6","14 September 2011"
"napierslogs","""One Day"", based on the novel of the same name, is the relationship of two people, Emma (Anne Hathaway) and Dexter (Jim Sturgess), as we see it on July 15th of each year. As can be expected from the nature of the story, it's a little dry, lacking in comedy. But then again, it's a romantic drama, not a romantic comedy.As is the nature of the two media, movies can never be exactly the same as the novel. But the problem with this one is that they tried to; no story lines were removed. Almost everything was there, just shortened into mostly meaningless segments. I personally could have done with one less event in their lives, and perhaps a different ending, but they tried to be as faithful as possible.What we have here is a movie about a relationship, but the novel was about the people. They traded in character depth and development so we can see them in their more attractive years falling in and out of love.I wasn't very familiar with Jim Sturgess, having seen him play skinny, slightly nerdy, not as confident kids. Dexter is a different breed of guy. Just has high on self-confidence as he is on drugs and alcohol, he gets by on his looks – literally – he's a TV host. Although the different characteristics of Dexter weren't explicitly shown in the movie, Sturgess brought them out in him perfectly. Emma is a more complex character, with significant evolution to who she is throughout the years, except none of that is in the movie, so it just wasn't really possible for Hathaway to portray her as a more interesting person.I would assume that watching ""One Day"" without the benefit of having read the novel would be a fairly confusing, empty experience. With the background that the novel gave me, I could fill in all the missing years and the unexplored layers to the characters, so there was still something to their relationship for me.","10","19 August 2011"
"TheBobbyjames","Very seldom in Hollywood are movies produced that are as emotionally involving as 'One Day.' It's a beautiful, beautiful love story of two people, Emma (Anne Hathaway) and Dex (Jim Sturgess). After spending the night together after graduation, we are taken on a journey into their lives for one day each year after they met; to see where they are or where they're not. Based on the book by David Nicholls (who also wrote the screenplay), 'One Day' transitions from novel to film brilliantly.First let me say film acting is what I believe makes or breaks a movie - if the actors are great, the movie is generally great. That's not to take away from any other element of film at all, but when everything else is done so well, if the acting were bad, the film would have been less memorable. But Anne Hathaway and Jim Sturgess are so very impressive here. They make their characters real and relatable, which are two key things every actor internally wishes they could do. In fact, as an on-screen pair, they work extremely well, together they exude chemistry.What I found most interesting about the entire experience was that I cared so much. I became enamoured with their lives. I kept hoping for the best. I anticipated what would happen to each of them. I sat forward, sat backward. I laughed and I cried. I've said many times before, a great movie will effect you emotionally in more ways than one. You'll be angry, you'll be happy, you'll be sad - the key is that you emote. This movie presented all of those elements. It was fresh and witty and everything you hope a movie will be. It's as beautifully made as it is acted and the locations are exquisite. Far too often, characters in Hollywood seem contrived and are not genuine. 'One Day' is honestly one of the most genuine stories ever told - there is no instant gratification, there is however frustration and that is the beauty of it all. It explores love and love lost, it explores friendship and the constraints of time and distance. It explores each character's journey to happiness and the trials they face along the way. So many little pieces of the puzzle are filled in between the years by simple, single lines of dialogue or actions. It's not the typical script of ""everything's all good-obstacle-everything ends well"" - there's a lot more complexity which makes it realistically genuine.So many little details, like eye-lines, smiles, sighs, cut-off conversations, etc. were paid attention to. The costuming, cinematography and score were spot on and all noteworthy. All of it combined was moving and awe-inspiring. I left the theater crying, but it didn't stop there, even thinking about the movie and those characters is deeply affecting. Maybe there are some underlying themes in the film that I'm identifying with, or maybe, just maybe the actors were really that great. Whatever it is, this film comes with my highest recommendation, is rated PG-13 and runs 107 minutes.","7","31 August 2011"
"TheLittleSongbird","The book was a wonderful read. One Day was a movie I was looking forward to, and while it was disappointing I found it very pleasant.What made the book so good and such a joy to read was not just the emotional impact, modern angst and characterisation but also how nostalgic it made me. The emotional impact and angst is here in the movie, what wasn't quite there was the nostalgia-evidence of it but could've been more- and characterisation which does feel choppy especially with Patricia Clarkson's Alison though Dexter is well realised.That said, I loved the beautiful look of the film, the soundtrack which gave the film its sense of nostalgia and the witty banter between Sturgess and Hathaway. The romantic elements are touching though the comedic elements don't always work coming across as a tad contrived. The direction is decent, the telling of the story is well paced(if somewhat glacial) and faithful and the script has some nice touches but also some weak ones. Of the support performances I thought Rafe Spall, Romola Garai and Ken Stott were the most effective and Clarkson was good if deserving of more to do. The picture belongs to Jim Sturgess, while staying true to his bad boy character of Dexter he also manages to be sympathetic.My feelings on Anne Hathaway were mixed. I loved her radiance and her chemistry with Sturgess, but her accent was inconsistent and felt forced and unnatural whenever she tried it. The shock ending also felt more bewildering than anything else, not the actual tragedy itself but rather the flashbacks that succeeded that I wasn't sure was really needed.In conclusion, pleasant if not entirely successful. 6.5/10 Bethany Cox","10","31 August 2011"
"JimmyCollins","Words cannot describe how wonderful an actress Anne Hathaway is, and in One Day she is in fine form, if there ever was an actress to go down in the history books among the greats it would be her. Jim Sturgess is quite a charming devil swell.The story that takes place in One Day is at moments the anti love story and other times a sweeping epic romance, even though this movie has been adapted from a book it's still a lot more original than other romantic themed films of late. Lone Scherfig definitely suits this style of English romance, starting with An Education and now this, it may sound mean but I just don't think the romantic dramas that come from the U.S have the same genuine feel that the English films do.I had read the book and i have to say that this is a very loyal adaptation, much of the beauty from the book is clear and present here, particularly the friendship aspect between Dex and Emma, in the book it's a quirky kind of friendship and it transferred well on the screen as, I was very pleased that the film makers didn't ruin that with a cheap silly sexual type of friendship.I could say a lot about how lovely this movie is but I think I'll let everyone make up their own mind. A lot of people have a bad opinion of this movie which I find baffling but I suppose each to their own, I just got totally wrapped up in this gorgeous romance.10 out of 10","9","3 September 2011"
"queen_of_naboo88","I went to see One Day last night, and though I had been looking forward to it for a while, I was surprised at how good it actually is. The film has a very unique atmosphere, as it is much quirkier than your average romance. Also, without giving away the ending, I can say that it isn't as predictable as one might think. What I really liked about it was the complexity of the different human relationships that we are shown. The relationship between Emma and Dexter is by no means an easy one, nor is it one-sided. Given how different they are, there is a lot of conflict between them, although they do love each other. Similarly, what Dexter and his ex-wife feel for one another is never pure hatred, but there is a lot of understanding between them. As a consequence, the story seems like it could be taken from real life. Plus, both Hathaway and Sturgess are as convincing as always, which makes this film absolutely worth seeing.","9","19 August 2011"
"guest_pabby","After perusing other reviews for this movie, I believe that many of the ratings are low, not because viewers disliked the movie, but because they disliked the element in which the film shines. The film succeeds in drawing the audience into the friendship between the main characters, played by Jim Sturgess and Anne Hathaway. Both characters find happiness and meaning in parts of their lives, while suffering through other portions without attaining goals they've set for themselves; i.e., this is real life.What the poorly-rating reviewers seek is escapism. In my view--however limited--this film aims to depict two human beings as they learn, grow, and fall in and out of touch with one another. Thus, don't expect any fairy tales here and don't punish the rating on this movie because it isn't a fairy tale! A predictable conclusion to this movie would place Sturgess and Hathaway side by side, married, and living together untouched by the trials of a realistic relationship. Instead, the director effectively and with calculation showcases some of life in the scenes and merely hints at events not shown on the screen. As the film narrates exclusively through one date each year (hence, the name), partial narratives are expected. The final third of the film, shunned by a few reviewers, elevated the creative vision of the story because it introduces the unpredictable nature of real life into a movie that was otherwise a run-of-the-mill romance. Again, speaking in terms of the development between characters, the movie is above average. Speaking in terms of storyline, the first two-thirds, to a certain degree, lack what the final third delivers: surprise! The juxtaposition of the present with the past near the end of this film makes the events even more potent than they would have been. Audience members who do not fall into the ""half-wit"" category can follow the story, regardless of what the viewers who read the novel state in their reviews. Bravo! Lastly, Anne Hathaway is exceedingly lovely.","4","3 September 2011"
"ferguson-6","Greetings again from the darkness. I have not read David Nicholls' novel, but my understanding is that it is extremely well written and its loyal readers really connected with Emma and Dexter. If that's true, then this film version is even worse than I thought while watching.This literally is my least favorite type of movie. A movie that assumes its viewers are unable to think for themselves or judge the actions of its characters. In other words, the filmmakers take for granted that we will accept whatever is shown on the big screen.First let me say that I completely understand the school girl crush that a young Emma (Anne Hathaway) has on her classmate Dexter (Jim Sturgess). He is handsome and charismatic and comes from more money than she. I also understand Dexter's attraction to the lovely Emma. She is very pretty - despite the ridiculous over-sized glasses for the early scenes - and very intelligent, and a significantly nicer person than he.What makes absolutely no sense to me is her continued attraction to this drunken, empty soul for the next twenty years. She is too smart to pine away the years hoping he will wise up and coming running to her. We are supposed to believe that she has no interest in any other relationship other than the non-threatening one with flopping stand-up comedian Ian (played by Timothy Spall's son Rafe) and a ""boring"" French Jazz Pianist.Dexter's mother is played by Patricia Clarkson. As she is dying from cancer, she tells him that she believes he will grow into a good man, but isn't there yet. I guess we are supposed to take her word for it. Instead we only see Dexter go from a selfish pig as a TV personality to a defeated man who must perform manual labor for the first time in his life. My issue is that a defeated man is not necessarily a good man. A man resigned to his life has not necessarily reached enlightenment. Where is Emma's proof that he deserves her? Where is the indication that her life with him will be better? I tell you where ... in the mind of that school girl from years ago.Please don't mistake my words as that of one who has no faith in romantic stories. There are so many ways this story could have turned that it would have had me. Instead it chose a path that assumed I was ignorant ... totally accepting of ridiculous story being laid out for me.My final comments on the film involve the cast. Anne Hathaway is an incredibly talented performer. She is not, however, British. Her accent is terribly distracting. Jim Sturgess is a handsome guy, but just not charismatic enough to pull off the TV personality role. Patricia Clarkson is a fantastic actress, but she is not British either. Seriously, are there not enough British actresses? The casting smells like a money-grubbing production team. As for director Lone Scherfig ... her previous film An Education was cinematic excellence. This is an unacceptable follow-up and we expect better next time.I will say the locations of Edinburg, London and Paris were beautiful and different than we usually get from the movies. That provided the only real enjoyment from this highly disappointing movie.","5","21 August 2011"
"Rob-O-Cop","this had some great aspects to it but ultimately failed to deliver. Firstly the good. Brilliant locations, beautiful cinematography, Anne Hathaway delivers a good performance,The bad. The editor and the director failed to establish a believable connection between the two lead actors as to why they would form a lasting bond that would carry them over 20 years. We're given a hint of this at the end but that doesn't help or fix the rest of the movie, so that's the bad editing aspect of this. if this scene had been at the front it might have helped sell the movie. That that scene didn't really deliver the goods needed to make it believable is the directors mistake along with many of the other scenes that tips the scale against the characters. Too many scenes of Dexter being a jerk and not enough of him being in anyway lovable or charming, even though there was much amusement to be had in the jerk Dexter scenes they blew out the balance of his character and it wasn't till the end that we got to see him as anything less than a jerk, but by then it was too late and it didn't really do anything to alter the confusion of why Emma would have cared. I also didn't buy Jim Sturgess performance, although a lot of people think differently, he came across as a caricature rather than a character. People have criticised Anne Hathaway's accent and there's probably some weight to that but I personally didn't find it annoying once I thought what's going on with her accent as it fluctuated all over the show. That's a continuity and a direction flaw as much as it is her performance. After a few mins I put it in the multi-sourced accent file as many people have blended accents. Outside of that Anne's delivering some really good depth in her work so much so that we may one day forgive her for the princess diaries.","9","27 January 2012"
"francine-k","I had watched ""One Day"" yesterday and was beyond excited because I had read the novel by David Nicholls, which was fantastic. The movie base's around 2 people and their twenty years together, shown only through one day, July 15th. I thought the plot was unique and was a very realistic romance. Sometimes it takes people a lot to lose to realize what life is about, and how certain people are truly important to you. The movie was cute, funny, and quite sad at times. I thought Anne Hathaway did an okay job on the accent, to me it was odd at first but after a couple minutes I had gotten used to it. Her acting was great and you can really see her changing as the years progress. Jim Sturgess was great and in my opinion really portrayed Dexter the best as possible, with the arrogance and attitude exactly as I imagined Dexter would have. In my own opinion the movie was a great watch, was a romance that I had been dying for ever sense The Notebook. Finally a tear jerking but smile at the end movie, that really anyone can enjoy, if your looking for a romance movie.","7","20 August 2011"
"JohnDeSando","One Day is promoted as drama romance and not a rom com. On all three counts I would call it out anyway, for it is a melodramatic, episodic tale of two best friends in London, Emma (Anne Hathaway) and Dexter (Jim Sturgess), who flirt with love over a long period but play on the standard cliché that requires they eventually end up together, regardless how many marriages and children intervene.One Day has too many short episodes from college in the '80's until professional life in 2011, and each seems just a variation on another before it: boy gets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl back again, well, you know the routine. During all these little skirmishes Emma remains wholesome (no stretch for the perpetually cute Hathaway, reminding me of Sally Hawkins' Poppy in Mike Leigh's Happy Go Lucky. But without Hawkins' charisma).Dexter is a cad and Lothario almost all the way, making him unlikeable and difficult to gain our sympathy. His cavalier treatment of his mother (the ever-interesting Patricia Clarkson) and father (Ken Stott) adds to his surly persona. In addition, Sturgess needs a little coaching or better script if he wishes to catch up with the Ryans (Gosling and Reynolds) in the emerging leading-man lineup.Nowhere do I feel a real sexual heat, especially since in most of the film they are avowing to be just friends. Moreover in the numerous years/episodes I do not feel the intellectual and emotional connection that comes so naturally in Richard Linklater's Before Sunrise/Sunset series. Even director Lone Scherfig's Parisian scenes are vacant, poor cousins to Woody Allen's romantic City of Lights in Midnight in Paris.As an Anglophile, I usually can forgive many sins if a film gives me an adequate dose of the great city, but as with the Paris background, romance takes a holiday even from the cities.","8","23 August 2011"
"blanbrn","Over the summer I saw this film sure it's typical chick flick, still as a male I admire the beauty and sexy look of Anne Hathaway who I think is a brilliant actress. Plus I think she pulled the international accent off just fine in this film and as always her look is sharp and just fine. This is a love story that spans time with memories these moments touch you staying with you forever despite when an unexpected tragedy strikes.Set in England it involves a couple Em(Anne Hathaway) and Dexter(Jim Sturgess) and after this international couple graduates from college and meet and fall for one another on July 15, 1989. From every year on on this date it's considered an anniversary for this couple as the film shows the special moments that happened during the lives of both. As each year on the same day is highlighted you see that no matter what path their lives have taken love and memories draw them together.Overall this is a film of memory and everlasting love sadly an unexpected tragedy occurs, but still with memories Dexter will love Em forever as long as memories are around love can last forever. Probably not a great film but worth a watch for any Anne Hathaway fan.","7","10 October 2011"
"jeffallenhammer","Does life imitate art or does art imitate life? I'm one who tends to avoid the discussion entirely by saying ""both."" One Day is the most real (save a few accents) movie I've seen in a long time. It explores time and how it often slips away from us. Our hearts' desires are often decimated by bad timing, and the movie finds a variety of ways to demonstrate this. So in the case of One Day, art imitates life to the fullest, as we can all sympathize (if only a little) to crushed hopes and shattered dreams, though hopefully we eventually find our way.Anne Hathaway stars as insecure working-class woman Emma, who, for one reason or another is drawn to Dexter, (Jim Sturgess) a charming upper middle class man with a great amount of self-confidence. It may be hard to understand just what the two have on each other, but they are characters I'm familiar with. The woman who is way too into a man that's way too into himself, it happens and for the type, Dex is pretty likable. Em and Dex have nothing in common. But their opposite personalities do what a relationship should; make each other better. They are Yin and Yang, complementary opposites.An interesting technique used by One Day, is that we only get to see the events of a single day, July 15, for each of 20 plus years. Some of my peers have taken to calling this a gimmick. In a year where it seems every other film is either a sequel or a remake/reboot, (which critics and public alike have grown tired of) I feel fresh ideas should be applauded, even if it doesn't quite work. For me, however, it worked to perfection. Director Lone Scherfig (An Education) paints the picture of Em and Dex's up and down relationship with great finesse, never having too much happen on the date year to year. The filmmaker fills us in on what has taken place throughout each year, without conversations seeming inorganic. The cinematography is beautiful, especially a scene where our would-be lovers break all their rules by taking a dip at sunset. There's plenty of humor, joy, sadness, regret and a number of other emotions to be felt. I caution viewers that this isn't a romantic comedy, nor does it end like one. One Day is, however, easily one of the most heartfelt films of the year and should be celebrated for its bravery.","4","31 August 2011"
"fernandoschiavi","Based on David Nichols' bestseller, ""One Day"" is a more mature Nicholas Sparks version, but equally tearful and melodramatic. Based on a peculiar and intriguing narrative structure, which revisits the 15th of July in the lives of Dexter and Emma since 1988 over more than 20 years, the story focuses on the maturation of the relationship between its characters, fleeing the punctuality and immediacy that surrounds most novels. Ironically, this same artifice reveals the main weakness of the script - others will be seen in the following paragraphs - because the annual reunion with the characters does not hide the considerable loss of information that motivated sudden changes in the life and behavior of each one.Sensitively directed by the Danish Lone Scherfig (""Education""), who delicately builds the fluid dynamic between Dexter and Emma (Hathaway), One Day is skillful in establishing the passage of time also with the aid of an impeccable make-up job - and notice how Sturgess, in particular, goes from a smooth-faced, jovial boy to a weary middle-aged man with wrinkles and bags under his eyes, while Hathaway emerges chubby (but not exaggeratedly so) after working two years as a waitress in a Mexican restaurant, which is an interesting detail. Benefiting from a competent cast that creates equally complex secondary characters that help compose the journey of the main couple (worth mentioning Rafe Spall, son of Timothy, who transforms the aspiring comedian Ian into a man that is simultaneously pathetic and moving), the film fails here and there by investing in stereotyped characterizations, but still avoiding that they dominate the narrative - and if Dexter's father appears as the typical ""cold and critical father"", Ken Stott manages to make him softer through occasional hesitations that point out his internal effort to try to get closer to the child.Likewise, if Nicholls' dialogues are occasionally forced to appeal to exposition in order to clarify what happened to the characters in the previous year, this is balanced by the good construction of so many other lines (especially those spoken by Hathaway), which they display the cold irony typical of British humor (Emma at one point describes the restaurant where she works as a ""graveyard of ambitions""). As if that were not enough, the script also creates really sensitive interactions between those people, highlighting the brief and beautiful scene between Dexter and his mother, who, played by Patricia Clarkson, shows melancholy and love when telling her son that, even certain that he will be a good man, realizes that he ""isn't there yet"".The dialogues are a strong point of the script, also written by David Nicholls. They are fast, with intelligent insights and manage to perfectly translate the personality of each character and their relationships with each other. Even with silly jokes, like Dexter's mother in Paris saying to her son, ""look over there, Alain Delon"" ... or not, it's your father"", demonstrating how much she is in love with her husband. There are funny scenes too, like when Dexter plays the most famous scene of Spartacus with the dolls for his daughter. But no character is better translated by the dialogues than Emma, the shy girl, but extremely intelligent and sagacious. Each of her lines is a bit of her temperament, feeling, spontaneity.However, it is even in the construction of Dexter and Emma that ""One Day"" proves to be particularly efficient: while the boy quickly achieves professional success, the girl struggles for years trying to make her artistic aspirations viable - a situation that gradually reverses as that we perceive that the former lacks the intellectual, emotional and psychological content that sustains his career, while Emma, growing from suffering, reflection and the simple experience of life, gradually transforms herself into a mature woman and ready to overcome the obstacles that previously prevented it from moving forward (and Sturgess and Hathaway, talented and charismatic, confidently illustrate these changes).The problem is that Hathaway's character quickly becomes the link with the audience. The dreamy sweetness, the sweetness and the detachment transform Emma into a very pleasant company, something that Dexter cannot see. Unsympathetic, self-centered and narcissistic, he uses Emma more as someone to quench the loneliness caused by her personality and assuage her pain and addictions than as a true friendship. Played by the expressionless Sturgess and his characteristic face of suffering, it is practically impossible to believe the beautiful and sensitive Emma fell in love with the guy after a disastrous dinner in which he exposes her (dis)interest. In this way, she emerges as the tragic anchor of the narrative, surrendering herself to the loves of a person she does not love, just to fill the sentimental need. What is revealed in the most cliché of sentences, enunciated according to the Nicholas Sparks booklet: ""she made him decent; you made her happy"".As Emma and Dexter mature, the adolescent, dreamy and inconsequential traits give way to realistic, cynical and disillusioned versions, propelled by tragedies, some of them approached with excessive disregard and disengagement due to the narrative structure - yet another negative effect of this. Elevated to the status of protagonist, an incorrect and questionable decision, Dexter undergoes a wide dramatic arc from his mother's illness (Clarkson), the cancellation of the television program, his marriage to Sylvie (Romola Garai, the young woman from ""Desire and Reparation"" and increasingly better actress), to an event that would definitely humanize him. At times, Emma's life is described in terms of her dream of becoming a writer or her relationship with Ian (Rafe Spall), which is disappointing.By scrutinizing and dissecting fractions of those characters' lives, certain moments should be more appropriately explored in David Nicholls' script. Dexter's firing after a botched interview and being hired on a video game show lacks a glimpse into the character's journey, though we understand what led to this precipitous fall. Similarly, Emma's relationship with Ian, presented at a dinner party without sparks or the guy's inability to make jokes, culminates in the explanation that she can't ""take him watching Wrath of Khan every day anymore"". This excessive exposition becomes constant in the film, requiring that a character needs to contextualize the events that are taking place to the public, which exposes the artificiality of the undertaking; well, if Emma and Dexter are such good friends, it was expected that he would reveal the bad news in the expected time and not months later.On the other hand, the annual narrative is well explored by Danish director Lone Scherfig, and the use of raccords and ellipses in Barney Pilling's montage stands out. And not just temporality, but the duo of characters allows Benoît Delhomme's photography to individualize Emma's trajectory in a nostalgic sepia, while Dexter is bathed in a depressing bluish color palette. Finally, Rachel Portman's score avoids being too intrusive, competently punctuating the narrative. Yes, the idea is curious and the narrative exercise valid (albeit flawed). The trajectory of two people is drawn before our eyes and, let's face it, it's not something usual in novel production. It is a pity, therefore, that the chosen 15th of July sounds hopelessly clichéd and expositional, making the unknown 364 remaining days of each year seem more interesting by comparison.We cannot, however, say that the film is not romantic. It has its moments, even if it prepares us to tears in such an obvious and brief way. Soon we will be in the next year, and the year after that, forgetting the pain and moving on. But that doesn't stop us from living in the moment. They are brief, it is true, but true and well-constructed. Especially in the final act, where we desperately want to go back to the beginning, as an attempt to remake the story, or at least fool our minds with that simple encounter in the middle of the street and a kiss seals the love story that should have been. Director Lone Scherfig managed to bring delicacy to the story of Emma and Dexter, making ""One Day"" a sensitive film. A love story built without resources common to films of this nature. Everything is almost realistic and fearful as life. She regrets that, when the situation picks up, she pulls the rug out from under us, with a cliché situation, announced, made just to make us cry. And she didn't even make it. Still, a good movie of its kind.","3","12 May 2023"
"Likes_Ninjas90","In the late 80s a girl named Emma (Anne Hathaway) is a college student who meets fellow graduate Dexter (Jim Sturgess). They're about to sleep together one evening but decide to remain friends instead. Over the course of twenty years we see how circumstances and other people have kept them divided when they just want to be together. Dexter finds himself hosting a ghastly television show, while being warned by his sick mother (Patricia Clarkson) that he isn't a particularly nice person anymore. He insists that he just wants to have fun, despite being critically panned and moving between women. Emma works her way up from a job in a fast food restaurant, to a teacher and then eventually into a successful author. To the distress of Dexter she has a serious relationship with an obnoxious comedian, which puts her real desires on hold. Late in the timeline, Dexter is married rather unhappily and has a baby girl to look after. An unlikeable leading man makes this one day too many. It's impossible to say what type of movie One Day is. It postures as a comedy but it barely raises a single laugh. And though it also lacks dramatic impact for much of its length too, its one climax is so shocking and over the top that it will leave a sour taste in your mouth. Do not consider this as a date movie. You will not be popular. You also have to wonder late in the movie what the point was. Director Lone Scherfig (An Education, 2009) tries to end things on a very syrupy note. That's very nice for one of the characters but unrewarding for the audience who have waded through twenty years in the lives of these unappealing characters for nothing. The message is ultimately a very obvious, unoriginal and simple one: that life pulls people in opposite directions but happiness can be found in one single moment. Using an extended chronological structure is a gimmick. It allows for little on screen titles to appear in the frame, just like in (500) Days of Summer (2009) but it refuses to enrich character. A film like Blue Valentine (2010) is infinitively more intelligent because it realises that character is structure. It contrasts the past and present day to visualise the changing personalities of its leads and the impact on their relationship. The script by David Nicholls, adapting his own novel, lacks this kind of sophistication. Having the film move through such an extensive period suggests that there will be arching transformations in the characters. But unfortunately Sturgess remains continuously unlikeable all throughout this movie. His character is arrogant, rude, promiscuous and irresponsible. And briefly touching on his fractured relationship with his parents does not make him anymore sympathetic. Patricia Clarkson is barely in this movie because she has so few scenes and I wasn't moved by her appearances as the film intended. One of the golden rules of the romantic comedy is broken here: you don't understand why Emma and Dexter belong together. This is a detriment to the film's plotting and the motives of the characters. We're left wondering what this apparently sophisticated woman continues to see in this buffoon, especially when she's already with better company. Even after that huge climax Dexter still has a moment of madness. Only at the very end does he wake up to himself. The actors aren't really to blame. Anne Hathaway is such a pleasant actress in almost everything she does, comedy or otherwise. But this sketchy, underwritten role wastes her talents and doesn't stretch her chops at all. She's made to look dorky and uptight with her over-sized glasses, only to move into little but quirkiness. And Jim Sturgess who I liked in Across the Universe (2007) and The Way Back (2010) is gifted too, with no shortage of personality. He just happens to be playing a real jerk. If that's what he intended, he certainly succeeded. As far as the rebirth of frank romantic-comedies goes this is a pretty uninspired and limp entry.","3","24 August 2011"
"ianlouisiana","Here in the UK we call people like this ""Up themselves""and I can't think of a film where that description of the characters is more applicable.
One frankly poisonous bloke with his brains in his pants tries for 20 - odd years to seduce a girl he was at university with.
That,basically,is what ""One Day"" is all about.
It's not a love story for heaven sake,he is pathologically incapable of feeling so complex an emotion.
Except towards himself.
She wastes a significant proportion of her life waiting for him to change into a completely different person then,quite inexplicably decides she'll take him on as he is.Maybe she is hearing her biological clock.ticking.
Whatever,she dumps her French jazz pianist boyfriend so quickly he hardly has time to learn the melodic minor scale.
The device on which ""One Day"" hangs is so flimsy I lost interest very early on.
It might have been more winning if the writer had made the ""One Day"" the 29th February - at least it would have been over sooner.
All you need to know about the characters is that they play the terribly posh game ""Are you there,Moriarty"",an Oxbridge version of Blind Man's Buff with added violence .
Under the guise of which the seriously unpleasant guy smacks his girlfriend very hard in the face with a rolled up newspaper,causing her nose to bleed.
She(the lovely Romelai Garai - by far the best performance)still marries him and has his baby.
Well,I never said they were clever.","8","25 February 2018"
"chaz-28","There is a lingering and persistent distraction throughout One Day which severely impairs the audience from becoming absorbed in the film. This is Anne Hathaway's atrocious accent. Many Americans have at varying degrees in the past successfully pulled off a believable British accent. However, Anne Hathaway's character, Emma Morley, sounds at different times Irish, Scottish, and American, but never British. It truly was irritating after awhile. Why didn't the filmmakers just cast a British actress? Or, if they were dead set on Hathaway playing Emma, then move the whole story to America. If not for the distracting aural miscues, this film would most likely be much more enjoyable.Emma and Dexter (Jim Sturgess) meet the night of college graduation at the tail end of an all night party. This is not a meet-cute either. They are the only two left as the last couple pairs off with each other; therefore, fate has thrown them together to have a one night stand. Things get in the way and they end up deciding to be friends and start a very long platonic relationship. This is mostly convincing as Emma is seen to be truly infatuated with Dexter who does not see her in the same light, in fact, he treats her rather poorly as the years go by. Graduation night was July 15th by the way so naturally the pair concocts a plan to meet up annually on that day or at least check in my telephone if this is not possible.Surprisingly, every July 15th is actually a pretty horrible, sad day for each of them. Very rarely is one or both of them in a good mood and happy with where their life is at when the film jumps forward to another July 15th. Furthermore, the film focuses much more on Dexter than Emma with extensive scenes concerning his alcoholism and career missteps. Emma even authors a successful book and it hardly gets a mention until Dexter happens upon it. This made me wonder that if Dexter was to have so much more attention and screen time than Emma, why all the fuss to make Anne Hathaway British? Since the screenplay was written by the same gentlemen who wrote the novel this film is based on, the story's climax is inevitable even though it is forced and manipulative. The scene is also very poorly shot. The director, Lone Scherfig, who made the brilliant An Education two years ago, completely misses the mark with this scene and the rest of the film suffers for it. The event is set up in a way that even people who venture out and see one movie a year will be able to see what is coming up.Another miscue is Patricia Clarkson's role as Dexter's mother. It feels her role has been severely cut during the editing process. Not only does she have dialogue in the preview which is not in the movie, but she only shows up in about two-three scenes, moves the plot along, and then she's out of there. I have not read the novel, but I guarantee she is a much larger presence on those pages than what seems to be a faint echo of her in this movie.P.S. There is an atrocious Elvis Costello song over the closing credits which destroys any lingering fondness or afterthoughts the audience may have been enjoying during the closing scenes.","10","24 August 2011"
"Ali_John_Catterall","Yes, entirely predictably (well, you probably guessed as much from the trailer), they made an utter pig's ear of it. The Good:As Dex, Jim Sturgess is decent - nails the look, and the accent (both of them). Rafe Spall, as hapless wannabe comedian Ian is also fine - although there isn't a scintilla of genuine anguish about him when he's dumped, but hey, it's not his story right? (To be honest, it's a wonder they didn't simply represent him with a balloon on a stick.)It does have a few reflective moments of stillness, which are incredibly welcome - mostly concerning Dex and family (if the book was arguably slanted more towards Emma's side of the story, here it favours Dex) - but they're all too rare.The Bad:All too rare, because this one zips along like it's left the iron on (no mean feat in an 108 minute movie), galloping toward the denouement so that any emotional investment we might have made in it is almost completely wiped out. 1997, for example, literally lasts a swimming pool length. I know book-to-film adaptations bowdlerise to an extent, but this is absolutely ridiculous. There's also an argument to be made about the wisdom of letting writers adapt their own screenplays. Perhaps some sense of objectivity is lost in the process. Oddly enough, a previous David Nicholls' TV mini-series called 'I Saw You', starring Fay Ripley, is practically a warm-up for One Day, and is absolutely wonderful - very worth tracking down. That was in three parts. If the makers of One Day hadn't been so concerned with making a quick buck (usual story), this would have benefited from a mini-series of its own. But then, of course, there's no money in Telly.At its worst, the film's truncation manifests in a reliance on phone calls between the pair, which makes it seem as if Sturgess is frankly *stalking* Anne Hathaway. *That* twist, at least, is intact, and somewhat shocking. But in the same way a sudden glimpse of a mink being flayed alive in the middle of a Disney cartoon might be.Couldn't they have found one single British actress for crying out loud? Yes, I know only too well about the need for overseas investment. But you're not looking at Anne Hathaway thinking, 'working-class Northener' you're distractedly thinking, 'Isn't that... Anne Hathaway, working in a Tex Mex restaurant in Camden?'Romola Garai, who plays Sophie, would have done better - dressed-down a bit. (Or as often suggested, Carey Mulligan.) And how do they pull off Hathaway being only subtly attractive? Oversize specs. Because, you know, specs always make people look *dowdy*, apparently. I'm not even going to talk about her accent. You've heard it. It ranges from Angela's Ashes to... well, to Hathaway's own American accent, in fact.The Ugly:The more I think about this, the crosser I get. Film Emma never has any tawdry affairs, as in the novel, as it wouldn't suit her martyred character - and it wouldn't suit the fragrant Hathaway. A layered, interesting character becomes a 2-dimensional pouter; pure and nun-like. Just waiting around for Dexter to be ready, waiting for him to finally come around, and save her tormented soul. It's repulsive, actually - and *totally* a betrayal of her character and the spirit of the original. In short, it's not the very worst film in the world - it's just completely and utterly unremarkable; Sub-Richard Curtis, which is something this lovely and moving book just isn't.","9","19 August 2011"
"sdebord3136","I was pleasantly surprised by this film. I thought this was going to be another chick flick with a guy flirting with a girl but I found it was an amazing love story that spans 2 decades and gives a glimpse of what true love could really be. Anne H. was great for this because she is a timeless beauty that played her role through the years wonderfully, and Jim S. did a great job evolving with his character through immaturity to understanding. The European setting was beautiful and added to the scenes from the city to country side building the romance of it all.I wish I would have seen it sooner :)","8","20 November 2011"
"axxmy_one","People keep saying that movie adaptations from novels are usually not the same. Some are bad, some are okay, but in this case, it was beautiful. Lots of credit goes to David Nicholls for his excellent screenplay. Everything was PERFECT. Timeline, storyline and even the small details was well written. The acting was impeccable too. What about Anne Hathaway's accent? No problems there. Jim Sturgess plays the character Dexter perfectly. Most people would say that The Notebook is the top romantic teary eyed film. I tell them this: One Day is way better. It shows that two people can have friendship, loyalty, affection and love continuously. Watch it. Whether you have read the book or not, you will fall in love with Dexter & Emma !","1","24 November 2011"
"juneebuggy","I was a huge fan of the book by David Nicholls and really looked foreword to seeing this... And while it didn't quite live up to my expectations and somewhat failed to capture the love and tragedy of the novel it was still a decent enough romance.The lovely Jim Sturgess plays rich playboy Dexter, with the (mostly irritating) Anne Hathaway as working class woman Em. We join them in 1988 on the night of their college graduation where they almost get together, decide to be friends and then proceed to follow them over the course of the next two decades.We see them through assorted relationships, phone calls, fights, hopes, vacations, missed opportunities, laughter and tears. There is always the anticipation of, will these two ever get together? The tone of the movie is different than the book, trying to be a bit like 'When Harry Met Sally' and failing. I also didn't ever feel the connection between Dexter and Em. I guess I should stop comparing the two, apples and oranges and all that but when you adore a book as much as I did its hard.The ageing of the characters is very well done here, subtle but especially apparent at the very end when the movie flips back to the night they met and you go wow, look how young they were. The clothing is also true to the decade and there are some fun (bad) hairstyles. 1/4/15","9","1 April 2015"
"neil-476","I give advance notice that I am going to be spoilering fairly extensively as this review goes on: you have been warned. Spoiler-free synopsis: Emma and Dexter meet on the day they graduate from university (July 15th 1988): there is an instant connection, and they nearly do the deed, but not quite. Instead, they enter into a long-term friendship which we, the audience, look in on every year on the anniversary of their meeting. Without giving anything away at this point, Emma becomes a waitress and would-be author who takes up with an unsuccessful stand-up comedian, and Dexter becomes a promiscuous TV presenter. We can see that that, ideally, they should be together because Emma desperately loves Dexter, and would be able to turn him from the louche, dissolute rake he has become into the decent man he has the potential to be. But, as the years go by, they always shy away from it. Anne Hathaway plays Emma and Jim Sturgess plays Dexter.Let me comment on a couple of points frequently mentioned elsewhere. One, I had no problem with Anne Hathaway's accent. It was, mostly, a tolerable all purpose moderately well-spoken British accent, with occasional ""oop north"" flattened vowels unnecessarily thrown in. It didn't distract me. Two, I understand that the book is a big hit with a chunk of the audience (the cinema audience was mostly older women in pairs, some with husbands dragged along. I was the only solo male). I haven't read the book, so I have no comment as to how well the film represented it.This film irritated me. I recognise that I am not part of the target demographic for a romantic drama, but I can be reached: my tear glands are perfectly prepared to well up in appropriate circumstances. However, I left the cinema dry-eyed and stony-faced: this film did not touch me in the slightest.I think I was irritated with it right from the start. A young man, subsequently shown to be highly promiscuous, ends up in bed with a girl who is ready and willing, and then - nothing happens? No, I don't think so. From then onwards I was constantly aware of the attempted pushing of emotional manipulation buttons, and it just didn't work. I thought the acting was fine, the period atmosphere good despite the odd anachronism, but I couldn't see why these two totally dissimilar people were soulmates, nor why they kept in touch, what she saw in him - in short, nothing about the emotional side of the film worked for me at all.OK, now I'm going to get really spoilery. And then, after donkeys' years go by, and things go pear shaped for him, Dexter finally learns a bit of humility by which time Emma has found herself a French jazz pianist. She instantly dumps the poor pianist and takes up with Dexter. While trying for a baby of their own (he already has a daughter by a previous relationship), she - really, I'm warning you, stop reading now if you don't want to hit a B.I.G. spoiler - is killed in a traffic accident. We then enter the final section of the film which attempts to have its cake and eat it. Intercut with each other we see Dexter coming to terms with life after Emma's death, in touching (but all not that touching!) conversations with his daughter and Emma's old stand-up comedian boyfriend, plus we see a kind of re-set button version of the day Dexter and Emma first got together which leads us towards the more satisfying relationship they could have had/did have (?) For all these years.And that irritated me even more.I was never uninterested in what went on, but I should have been moved by this film, and I wasn't - and I think it is because it was full of emotional dishonesty from start to finish.","8","26 August 2011"
"jmc4769","I just got back home from seeing this movie, and I feel like I've been hit upside the head with a baseball bat. I'm a sucker for romantic movies, and I've sat through hundreds of mediocre ones that were watchable anyway. But One Day had to be one of the worst romance movies I have ever had the misfortune to endure. It was especially disappointing because I've loved Anne Hathaway in just about everything she's been in (Princess Diaries, Ella Enchanted, Rachel Getting Married, The Devil Wears Prada, Rio, etc.). One Day has few redeeming qualities, except for the occasional pretty scenery. The most serious problem is Jim Sturgess's character, Dexter. Dexter is an unlikable, shallow womanizer. I know what you're thinking: Charming womanizers are a staple of these movies. But Sturgess gives Dexter no charm, no glimmer of humanity, no hint that there may be lovable qualities beneath his contemptible persona. The usually wonderful Hathaway (Emma) gets mired down here in a bad script. And there is not the tiniest spark of chemistry between the two. I kept thinking, ""Come on, Emma, block this loser's number and take out a restraining order."" When the inevitable romance comes, it hasn't a shred of believability. This movie ultimately amounts to a plain Jane wish-fulfillment fantasy (yep, Hathaway is supposed to be plain)...sort of like those movies where the nerdy guy gets the hot girl. The plot structure is a big problem too. We see the main characters only on one day (July 15th) of every year from 1988 to 2011. Instead of continuity, character development, and relationship development, we get mostly uninteresting snippets of their lives. The final straw for me though was the surprise ending, which was a completely gratuitous attempt to insert meaningful drama into an otherwise vacuous movie. At this point, I was begging for the movie to be over, but no such luck. Incredibly, screenwriter (and author of the book of the same name), David Nicholls, drags this bad movie out for another 15 minutes or so.","6","19 August 2011"

"achyutaghosh","Disclaimer first up- biased review, as I am a sucker for love stories.I used to think that Hollywood had stopped making emotionally involving love stories. Thank god they made One Day, then. Based on the best selling book by British author Dave Nicholls, the movie explores the intertwined lives of two protagonists of contrasting nature, yet fated to be together. The premise is novel, with the relationship explored though a peek into 15th July of each year, spread over 22 years. Good stories are brought to life by good acting, and here we have two superb exponents in lead roles- Jim Sturgess as Dexter and Anna Hathaway as Emma. Dexter leads the high profile life, a television anchor with success in all forms chasing him, always. But then his life is also hollow, his friends shallow, and in the end, a faces disillusionment and compromise. Emma dwells in obscurity mostly, but through sheer tenacity and belief achieves a modicum of success as a writer. They meet when they are 18, decide to remain lifelong friends, and they do remain so. In the meanwhile meandering through the vagaries of life, they are inexorably drawn towards each other, dependent on each other.Childhood sweethearts, even if long lost, when they do come together, they do get together without any questions asked- i say this having witnessed the same on a close friend of mine. And you cant help but fall in love with Emma and Dexter- their love story is so compelling and adorable, that you become a part of their story, you care for them, you laugh with them, and also cry, you want them to do what you would do, and yes, you desperately want a happy ending for them.And of course there is Anna Hathaway-suitably rumpled and grunge in the first half, and elegance and grace personified in the second, when she flashes her pearly whites, the world seems to be a better place to live.Why do people in love get to be in love in the best of locations? One Day happens in picturesque Edinburgh, colourful London, and stylish Paris. And the best thing that makes it stand out among all love stories is that it is not predictable, till the very end. People and things change with time, but memories remain the same.- here's a movie that raises a toast to happy memories, a Must watch for mushy folks!","7","23 November 2011"
"Philby-3","One Day Two eighties graduates in Edinburgh have an encounter on graduation day, July 15th ; the film follows their relationship by annual updates. Dexter (Jim Sturgess) brilliant, charismatic and a total narcissist and Emma (Ann Hathaway), a demure, warm sort are not a great match and both hitch up with others, but their friendship endures.The film is romantic, but only to a point, and can hardly be described as a comedy; there is too much pain for that, despite some funny dialogue. It is a kind of growing older movie – early promise turning sour, bright young ambitious things tasting failure and settling for something less. The story is cleverly told and nicely shot, with good support from Ken Stott and Patricia Clarkson as Dexter's disapproving parents and Rhys Spall as Emma's husband. Jim Sturgess looks and acts uncannily like a younger Rupert Graves, who has portrayed a long line of charming handsome wastrels. Ann Hathaway might be from New York but she plays Emma perfectly – the dialect coaches really earned their money. Both of the principals manage to evoke our sympathy, though Sturgess has the harder job.July 15 is St Swithin's day. On that day in 1415 the English Army led by Henry V (alias Laurence Olivier or Kenneth Branagh) defeated a larger French force at Agincourt. This has absolutely nothing to do with the movie though Dexter and Emma do at one stage venture to Brittany, where they manage to lose their clothes in one of the film's more comedic moments.I couldn't help feeling the story arc was rather predictable but I was absorbed nonetheless. At the end I'm not sure what the attraction was for Emma – she was smart enough to realise Dexter was a jerk but somehow she couldn't resist. He does get better – perhaps deep down she wanted to reform him. Or perhaps deep down she wanted to be a bit wild too. A film for generation Xers who are wondering what the hell happened to their youthful dreams and plans.","10","14 September 2011"
"napierslogs","""One Day"", based on the novel of the same name, is the relationship of two people, Emma (Anne Hathaway) and Dexter (Jim Sturgess), as we see it on July 15th of each year. As can be expected from the nature of the story, it's a little dry, lacking in comedy. But then again, it's a romantic drama, not a romantic comedy.As is the nature of the two media, movies can never be exactly the same as the novel. But the problem with this one is that they tried to; no story lines were removed. Almost everything was there, just shortened into mostly meaningless segments. I personally could have done with one less event in their lives, and perhaps a different ending, but they tried to be as faithful as possible.What we have here is a movie about a relationship, but the novel was about the people. They traded in character depth and development so we can see them in their more attractive years falling in and out of love.I wasn't very familiar with Jim Sturgess, having seen him play skinny, slightly nerdy, not as confident kids. Dexter is a different breed of guy. Just has high on self-confidence as he is on drugs and alcohol, he gets by on his looks – literally – he's a TV host. Although the different characteristics of Dexter weren't explicitly shown in the movie, Sturgess brought them out in him perfectly. Emma is a more complex character, with significant evolution to who she is throughout the years, except none of that is in the movie, so it just wasn't really possible for Hathaway to portray her as a more interesting person.I would assume that watching ""One Day"" without the benefit of having read the novel would be a fairly confusing, empty experience. With the background that the novel gave me, I could fill in all the missing years and the unexplored layers to the characters, so there was still something to their relationship for me.","9","19 August 2011"
"TheBobbyjames","Very seldom in Hollywood are movies produced that are as emotionally involving as 'One Day.' It's a beautiful, beautiful love story of two people, Emma (Anne Hathaway) and Dex (Jim Sturgess). After spending the night together after graduation, we are taken on a journey into their lives for one day each year after they met; to see where they are or where they're not. Based on the book by David Nicholls (who also wrote the screenplay), 'One Day' transitions from novel to film brilliantly.First let me say film acting is what I believe makes or breaks a movie - if the actors are great, the movie is generally great. That's not to take away from any other element of film at all, but when everything else is done so well, if the acting were bad, the film would have been less memorable. But Anne Hathaway and Jim Sturgess are so very impressive here. They make their characters real and relatable, which are two key things every actor internally wishes they could do. In fact, as an on-screen pair, they work extremely well, together they exude chemistry.What I found most interesting about the entire experience was that I cared so much. I became enamoured with their lives. I kept hoping for the best. I anticipated what would happen to each of them. I sat forward, sat backward. I laughed and I cried. I've said many times before, a great movie will effect you emotionally in more ways than one. You'll be angry, you'll be happy, you'll be sad - the key is that you emote. This movie presented all of those elements. It was fresh and witty and everything you hope a movie will be. It's as beautifully made as it is acted and the locations are exquisite. Far too often, characters in Hollywood seem contrived and are not genuine. 'One Day' is honestly one of the most genuine stories ever told - there is no instant gratification, there is however frustration and that is the beauty of it all. It explores love and love lost, it explores friendship and the constraints of time and distance. It explores each character's journey to happiness and the trials they face along the way. So many little pieces of the puzzle are filled in between the years by simple, single lines of dialogue or actions. It's not the typical script of ""everything's all good-obstacle-everything ends well"" - there's a lot more complexity which makes it realistically genuine.So many little details, like eye-lines, smiles, sighs, cut-off conversations, etc. were paid attention to. The costuming, cinematography and score were spot on and all noteworthy. All of it combined was moving and awe-inspiring. I left the theater crying, but it didn't stop there, even thinking about the movie and those characters is deeply affecting. Maybe there are some underlying themes in the film that I'm identifying with, or maybe, just maybe the actors were really that great. Whatever it is, this film comes with my highest recommendation, is rated PG-13 and runs 107 minutes.","9","31 August 2011"
"TheLittleSongbird","The book was a wonderful read. One Day was a movie I was looking forward to, and while it was disappointing I found it very pleasant.What made the book so good and such a joy to read was not just the emotional impact, modern angst and characterisation but also how nostalgic it made me. The emotional impact and angst is here in the movie, what wasn't quite there was the nostalgia-evidence of it but could've been more- and characterisation which does feel choppy especially with Patricia Clarkson's Alison though Dexter is well realised.That said, I loved the beautiful look of the film, the soundtrack which gave the film its sense of nostalgia and the witty banter between Sturgess and Hathaway. The romantic elements are touching though the comedic elements don't always work coming across as a tad contrived. The direction is decent, the telling of the story is well paced(if somewhat glacial) and faithful and the script has some nice touches but also some weak ones. Of the support performances I thought Rafe Spall, Romola Garai and Ken Stott were the most effective and Clarkson was good if deserving of more to do. The picture belongs to Jim Sturgess, while staying true to his bad boy character of Dexter he also manages to be sympathetic.My feelings on Anne Hathaway were mixed. I loved her radiance and her chemistry with Sturgess, but her accent was inconsistent and felt forced and unnatural whenever she tried it. The shock ending also felt more bewildering than anything else, not the actual tragedy itself but rather the flashbacks that succeeded that I wasn't sure was really needed.In conclusion, pleasant if not entirely successful. 6.5/10 Bethany Cox","4","31 August 2011"
"JimmyCollins","Words cannot describe how wonderful an actress Anne Hathaway is, and in One Day she is in fine form, if there ever was an actress to go down in the history books among the greats it would be her. Jim Sturgess is quite a charming devil swell.The story that takes place in One Day is at moments the anti love story and other times a sweeping epic romance, even though this movie has been adapted from a book it's still a lot more original than other romantic themed films of late. Lone Scherfig definitely suits this style of English romance, starting with An Education and now this, it may sound mean but I just don't think the romantic dramas that come from the U.S have the same genuine feel that the English films do.I had read the book and i have to say that this is a very loyal adaptation, much of the beauty from the book is clear and present here, particularly the friendship aspect between Dex and Emma, in the book it's a quirky kind of friendship and it transferred well on the screen as, I was very pleased that the film makers didn't ruin that with a cheap silly sexual type of friendship.I could say a lot about how lovely this movie is but I think I'll let everyone make up their own mind. A lot of people have a bad opinion of this movie which I find baffling but I suppose each to their own, I just got totally wrapped up in this gorgeous romance.10 out of 10","5","3 September 2011"
"queen_of_naboo88","I went to see One Day last night, and though I had been looking forward to it for a while, I was surprised at how good it actually is. The film has a very unique atmosphere, as it is much quirkier than your average romance. Also, without giving away the ending, I can say that it isn't as predictable as one might think. What I really liked about it was the complexity of the different human relationships that we are shown. The relationship between Emma and Dexter is by no means an easy one, nor is it one-sided. Given how different they are, there is a lot of conflict between them, although they do love each other. Similarly, what Dexter and his ex-wife feel for one another is never pure hatred, but there is a lot of understanding between them. As a consequence, the story seems like it could be taken from real life. Plus, both Hathaway and Sturgess are as convincing as always, which makes this film absolutely worth seeing.","9","19 August 2011"
"guest_pabby","After perusing other reviews for this movie, I believe that many of the ratings are low, not because viewers disliked the movie, but because they disliked the element in which the film shines. The film succeeds in drawing the audience into the friendship between the main characters, played by Jim Sturgess and Anne Hathaway. Both characters find happiness and meaning in parts of their lives, while suffering through other portions without attaining goals they've set for themselves; i.e., this is real life.What the poorly-rating reviewers seek is escapism. In my view--however limited--this film aims to depict two human beings as they learn, grow, and fall in and out of touch with one another. Thus, don't expect any fairy tales here and don't punish the rating on this movie because it isn't a fairy tale! A predictable conclusion to this movie would place Sturgess and Hathaway side by side, married, and living together untouched by the trials of a realistic relationship. Instead, the director effectively and with calculation showcases some of life in the scenes and merely hints at events not shown on the screen. As the film narrates exclusively through one date each year (hence, the name), partial narratives are expected. The final third of the film, shunned by a few reviewers, elevated the creative vision of the story because it introduces the unpredictable nature of real life into a movie that was otherwise a run-of-the-mill romance. Again, speaking in terms of the development between characters, the movie is above average. Speaking in terms of storyline, the first two-thirds, to a certain degree, lack what the final third delivers: surprise! The juxtaposition of the present with the past near the end of this film makes the events even more potent than they would have been. Audience members who do not fall into the ""half-wit"" category can follow the story, regardless of what the viewers who read the novel state in their reviews. Bravo! Lastly, Anne Hathaway is exceedingly lovely.","7","3 September 2011"
"ferguson-6","Greetings again from the darkness. I have not read David Nicholls' novel, but my understanding is that it is extremely well written and its loyal readers really connected with Emma and Dexter. If that's true, then this film version is even worse than I thought while watching.This literally is my least favorite type of movie. A movie that assumes its viewers are unable to think for themselves or judge the actions of its characters. In other words, the filmmakers take for granted that we will accept whatever is shown on the big screen.First let me say that I completely understand the school girl crush that a young Emma (Anne Hathaway) has on her classmate Dexter (Jim Sturgess). He is handsome and charismatic and comes from more money than she. I also understand Dexter's attraction to the lovely Emma. She is very pretty - despite the ridiculous over-sized glasses for the early scenes - and very intelligent, and a significantly nicer person than he.What makes absolutely no sense to me is her continued attraction to this drunken, empty soul for the next twenty years. She is too smart to pine away the years hoping he will wise up and coming running to her. We are supposed to believe that she has no interest in any other relationship other than the non-threatening one with flopping stand-up comedian Ian (played by Timothy Spall's son Rafe) and a ""boring"" French Jazz Pianist.Dexter's mother is played by Patricia Clarkson. As she is dying from cancer, she tells him that she believes he will grow into a good man, but isn't there yet. I guess we are supposed to take her word for it. Instead we only see Dexter go from a selfish pig as a TV personality to a defeated man who must perform manual labor for the first time in his life. My issue is that a defeated man is not necessarily a good man. A man resigned to his life has not necessarily reached enlightenment. Where is Emma's proof that he deserves her? Where is the indication that her life with him will be better? I tell you where ... in the mind of that school girl from years ago.Please don't mistake my words as that of one who has no faith in romantic stories. There are so many ways this story could have turned that it would have had me. Instead it chose a path that assumed I was ignorant ... totally accepting of ridiculous story being laid out for me.My final comments on the film involve the cast. Anne Hathaway is an incredibly talented performer. She is not, however, British. Her accent is terribly distracting. Jim Sturgess is a handsome guy, but just not charismatic enough to pull off the TV personality role. Patricia Clarkson is a fantastic actress, but she is not British either. Seriously, are there not enough British actresses? The casting smells like a money-grubbing production team. As for director Lone Scherfig ... her previous film An Education was cinematic excellence. This is an unacceptable follow-up and we expect better next time.I will say the locations of Edinburg, London and Paris were beautiful and different than we usually get from the movies. That provided the only real enjoyment from this highly disappointing movie.","8","21 August 2011"
"Rob-O-Cop","this had some great aspects to it but ultimately failed to deliver. Firstly the good. Brilliant locations, beautiful cinematography, Anne Hathaway delivers a good performance,The bad. The editor and the director failed to establish a believable connection between the two lead actors as to why they would form a lasting bond that would carry them over 20 years. We're given a hint of this at the end but that doesn't help or fix the rest of the movie, so that's the bad editing aspect of this. if this scene had been at the front it might have helped sell the movie. That that scene didn't really deliver the goods needed to make it believable is the directors mistake along with many of the other scenes that tips the scale against the characters. Too many scenes of Dexter being a jerk and not enough of him being in anyway lovable or charming, even though there was much amusement to be had in the jerk Dexter scenes they blew out the balance of his character and it wasn't till the end that we got to see him as anything less than a jerk, but by then it was too late and it didn't really do anything to alter the confusion of why Emma would have cared. I also didn't buy Jim Sturgess performance, although a lot of people think differently, he came across as a caricature rather than a character. People have criticised Anne Hathaway's accent and there's probably some weight to that but I personally didn't find it annoying once I thought what's going on with her accent as it fluctuated all over the show. That's a continuity and a direction flaw as much as it is her performance. After a few mins I put it in the multi-sourced accent file as many people have blended accents. Outside of that Anne's delivering some really good depth in her work so much so that we may one day forgive her for the princess diaries.","7","27 January 2012"
"francine-k","I had watched ""One Day"" yesterday and was beyond excited because I had read the novel by David Nicholls, which was fantastic. The movie base's around 2 people and their twenty years together, shown only through one day, July 15th. I thought the plot was unique and was a very realistic romance. Sometimes it takes people a lot to lose to realize what life is about, and how certain people are truly important to you. The movie was cute, funny, and quite sad at times. I thought Anne Hathaway did an okay job on the accent, to me it was odd at first but after a couple minutes I had gotten used to it. Her acting was great and you can really see her changing as the years progress. Jim Sturgess was great and in my opinion really portrayed Dexter the best as possible, with the arrogance and attitude exactly as I imagined Dexter would have. In my own opinion the movie was a great watch, was a romance that I had been dying for ever sense The Notebook. Finally a tear jerking but smile at the end movie, that really anyone can enjoy, if your looking for a romance movie.","4","20 August 2011"
"JohnDeSando","One Day is promoted as drama romance and not a rom com. On all three counts I would call it out anyway, for it is a melodramatic, episodic tale of two best friends in London, Emma (Anne Hathaway) and Dexter (Jim Sturgess), who flirt with love over a long period but play on the standard cliché that requires they eventually end up together, regardless how many marriages and children intervene.One Day has too many short episodes from college in the '80's until professional life in 2011, and each seems just a variation on another before it: boy gets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl back again, well, you know the routine. During all these little skirmishes Emma remains wholesome (no stretch for the perpetually cute Hathaway, reminding me of Sally Hawkins' Poppy in Mike Leigh's Happy Go Lucky. But without Hawkins' charisma).Dexter is a cad and Lothario almost all the way, making him unlikeable and difficult to gain our sympathy. His cavalier treatment of his mother (the ever-interesting Patricia Clarkson) and father (Ken Stott) adds to his surly persona. In addition, Sturgess needs a little coaching or better script if he wishes to catch up with the Ryans (Gosling and Reynolds) in the emerging leading-man lineup.Nowhere do I feel a real sexual heat, especially since in most of the film they are avowing to be just friends. Moreover in the numerous years/episodes I do not feel the intellectual and emotional connection that comes so naturally in Richard Linklater's Before Sunrise/Sunset series. Even director Lone Scherfig's Parisian scenes are vacant, poor cousins to Woody Allen's romantic City of Lights in Midnight in Paris.As an Anglophile, I usually can forgive many sins if a film gives me an adequate dose of the great city, but as with the Paris background, romance takes a holiday even from the cities.","3","23 August 2011"
"blanbrn","Over the summer I saw this film sure it's typical chick flick, still as a male I admire the beauty and sexy look of Anne Hathaway who I think is a brilliant actress. Plus I think she pulled the international accent off just fine in this film and as always her look is sharp and just fine. This is a love story that spans time with memories these moments touch you staying with you forever despite when an unexpected tragedy strikes.Set in England it involves a couple Em(Anne Hathaway) and Dexter(Jim Sturgess) and after this international couple graduates from college and meet and fall for one another on July 15, 1989. From every year on on this date it's considered an anniversary for this couple as the film shows the special moments that happened during the lives of both. As each year on the same day is highlighted you see that no matter what path their lives have taken love and memories draw them together.Overall this is a film of memory and everlasting love sadly an unexpected tragedy occurs, but still with memories Dexter will love Em forever as long as memories are around love can last forever. Probably not a great film but worth a watch for any Anne Hathaway fan.","3","10 October 2011"
"jeffallenhammer","Does life imitate art or does art imitate life? I'm one who tends to avoid the discussion entirely by saying ""both."" One Day is the most real (save a few accents) movie I've seen in a long time. It explores time and how it often slips away from us. Our hearts' desires are often decimated by bad timing, and the movie finds a variety of ways to demonstrate this. So in the case of One Day, art imitates life to the fullest, as we can all sympathize (if only a little) to crushed hopes and shattered dreams, though hopefully we eventually find our way.Anne Hathaway stars as insecure working-class woman Emma, who, for one reason or another is drawn to Dexter, (Jim Sturgess) a charming upper middle class man with a great amount of self-confidence. It may be hard to understand just what the two have on each other, but they are characters I'm familiar with. The woman who is way too into a man that's way too into himself, it happens and for the type, Dex is pretty likable. Em and Dex have nothing in common. But their opposite personalities do what a relationship should; make each other better. They are Yin and Yang, complementary opposites.An interesting technique used by One Day, is that we only get to see the events of a single day, July 15, for each of 20 plus years. Some of my peers have taken to calling this a gimmick. In a year where it seems every other film is either a sequel or a remake/reboot, (which critics and public alike have grown tired of) I feel fresh ideas should be applauded, even if it doesn't quite work. For me, however, it worked to perfection. Director Lone Scherfig (An Education) paints the picture of Em and Dex's up and down relationship with great finesse, never having too much happen on the date year to year. The filmmaker fills us in on what has taken place throughout each year, without conversations seeming inorganic. The cinematography is beautiful, especially a scene where our would-be lovers break all their rules by taking a dip at sunset. There's plenty of humor, joy, sadness, regret and a number of other emotions to be felt. I caution viewers that this isn't a romantic comedy, nor does it end like one. One Day is, however, easily one of the most heartfelt films of the year and should be celebrated for its bravery.","8","31 August 2011"
"fernandoschiavi","Based on David Nichols' bestseller, ""One Day"" is a more mature Nicholas Sparks version, but equally tearful and melodramatic. Based on a peculiar and intriguing narrative structure, which revisits the 15th of July in the lives of Dexter and Emma since 1988 over more than 20 years, the story focuses on the maturation of the relationship between its characters, fleeing the punctuality and immediacy that surrounds most novels. Ironically, this same artifice reveals the main weakness of the script - others will be seen in the following paragraphs - because the annual reunion with the characters does not hide the considerable loss of information that motivated sudden changes in the life and behavior of each one.Sensitively directed by the Danish Lone Scherfig (""Education""), who delicately builds the fluid dynamic between Dexter and Emma (Hathaway), One Day is skillful in establishing the passage of time also with the aid of an impeccable make-up job - and notice how Sturgess, in particular, goes from a smooth-faced, jovial boy to a weary middle-aged man with wrinkles and bags under his eyes, while Hathaway emerges chubby (but not exaggeratedly so) after working two years as a waitress in a Mexican restaurant, which is an interesting detail. Benefiting from a competent cast that creates equally complex secondary characters that help compose the journey of the main couple (worth mentioning Rafe Spall, son of Timothy, who transforms the aspiring comedian Ian into a man that is simultaneously pathetic and moving), the film fails here and there by investing in stereotyped characterizations, but still avoiding that they dominate the narrative - and if Dexter's father appears as the typical ""cold and critical father"", Ken Stott manages to make him softer through occasional hesitations that point out his internal effort to try to get closer to the child.Likewise, if Nicholls' dialogues are occasionally forced to appeal to exposition in order to clarify what happened to the characters in the previous year, this is balanced by the good construction of so many other lines (especially those spoken by Hathaway), which they display the cold irony typical of British humor (Emma at one point describes the restaurant where she works as a ""graveyard of ambitions""). As if that were not enough, the script also creates really sensitive interactions between those people, highlighting the brief and beautiful scene between Dexter and his mother, who, played by Patricia Clarkson, shows melancholy and love when telling her son that, even certain that he will be a good man, realizes that he ""isn't there yet"".The dialogues are a strong point of the script, also written by David Nicholls. They are fast, with intelligent insights and manage to perfectly translate the personality of each character and their relationships with each other. Even with silly jokes, like Dexter's mother in Paris saying to her son, ""look over there, Alain Delon"" ... or not, it's your father"", demonstrating how much she is in love with her husband. There are funny scenes too, like when Dexter plays the most famous scene of Spartacus with the dolls for his daughter. But no character is better translated by the dialogues than Emma, the shy girl, but extremely intelligent and sagacious. Each of her lines is a bit of her temperament, feeling, spontaneity.However, it is even in the construction of Dexter and Emma that ""One Day"" proves to be particularly efficient: while the boy quickly achieves professional success, the girl struggles for years trying to make her artistic aspirations viable - a situation that gradually reverses as that we perceive that the former lacks the intellectual, emotional and psychological content that sustains his career, while Emma, growing from suffering, reflection and the simple experience of life, gradually transforms herself into a mature woman and ready to overcome the obstacles that previously prevented it from moving forward (and Sturgess and Hathaway, talented and charismatic, confidently illustrate these changes).The problem is that Hathaway's character quickly becomes the link with the audience. The dreamy sweetness, the sweetness and the detachment transform Emma into a very pleasant company, something that Dexter cannot see. Unsympathetic, self-centered and narcissistic, he uses Emma more as someone to quench the loneliness caused by her personality and assuage her pain and addictions than as a true friendship. Played by the expressionless Sturgess and his characteristic face of suffering, it is practically impossible to believe the beautiful and sensitive Emma fell in love with the guy after a disastrous dinner in which he exposes her (dis)interest. In this way, she emerges as the tragic anchor of the narrative, surrendering herself to the loves of a person she does not love, just to fill the sentimental need. What is revealed in the most cliché of sentences, enunciated according to the Nicholas Sparks booklet: ""she made him decent; you made her happy"".As Emma and Dexter mature, the adolescent, dreamy and inconsequential traits give way to realistic, cynical and disillusioned versions, propelled by tragedies, some of them approached with excessive disregard and disengagement due to the narrative structure - yet another negative effect of this. Elevated to the status of protagonist, an incorrect and questionable decision, Dexter undergoes a wide dramatic arc from his mother's illness (Clarkson), the cancellation of the television program, his marriage to Sylvie (Romola Garai, the young woman from ""Desire and Reparation"" and increasingly better actress), to an event that would definitely humanize him. At times, Emma's life is described in terms of her dream of becoming a writer or her relationship with Ian (Rafe Spall), which is disappointing.By scrutinizing and dissecting fractions of those characters' lives, certain moments should be more appropriately explored in David Nicholls' script. Dexter's firing after a botched interview and being hired on a video game show lacks a glimpse into the character's journey, though we understand what led to this precipitous fall. Similarly, Emma's relationship with Ian, presented at a dinner party without sparks or the guy's inability to make jokes, culminates in the explanation that she can't ""take him watching Wrath of Khan every day anymore"". This excessive exposition becomes constant in the film, requiring that a character needs to contextualize the events that are taking place to the public, which exposes the artificiality of the undertaking; well, if Emma and Dexter are such good friends, it was expected that he would reveal the bad news in the expected time and not months later.On the other hand, the annual narrative is well explored by Danish director Lone Scherfig, and the use of raccords and ellipses in Barney Pilling's montage stands out. And not just temporality, but the duo of characters allows Benoît Delhomme's photography to individualize Emma's trajectory in a nostalgic sepia, while Dexter is bathed in a depressing bluish color palette. Finally, Rachel Portman's score avoids being too intrusive, competently punctuating the narrative. Yes, the idea is curious and the narrative exercise valid (albeit flawed). The trajectory of two people is drawn before our eyes and, let's face it, it's not something usual in novel production. It is a pity, therefore, that the chosen 15th of July sounds hopelessly clichéd and expositional, making the unknown 364 remaining days of each year seem more interesting by comparison.We cannot, however, say that the film is not romantic. It has its moments, even if it prepares us to tears in such an obvious and brief way. Soon we will be in the next year, and the year after that, forgetting the pain and moving on. But that doesn't stop us from living in the moment. They are brief, it is true, but true and well-constructed. Especially in the final act, where we desperately want to go back to the beginning, as an attempt to remake the story, or at least fool our minds with that simple encounter in the middle of the street and a kiss seals the love story that should have been. Director Lone Scherfig managed to bring delicacy to the story of Emma and Dexter, making ""One Day"" a sensitive film. A love story built without resources common to films of this nature. Everything is almost realistic and fearful as life. She regrets that, when the situation picks up, she pulls the rug out from under us, with a cliché situation, announced, made just to make us cry. And she didn't even make it. Still, a good movie of its kind.","10","12 May 2023"
"Likes_Ninjas90","In the late 80s a girl named Emma (Anne Hathaway) is a college student who meets fellow graduate Dexter (Jim Sturgess). They're about to sleep together one evening but decide to remain friends instead. Over the course of twenty years we see how circumstances and other people have kept them divided when they just want to be together. Dexter finds himself hosting a ghastly television show, while being warned by his sick mother (Patricia Clarkson) that he isn't a particularly nice person anymore. He insists that he just wants to have fun, despite being critically panned and moving between women. Emma works her way up from a job in a fast food restaurant, to a teacher and then eventually into a successful author. To the distress of Dexter she has a serious relationship with an obnoxious comedian, which puts her real desires on hold. Late in the timeline, Dexter is married rather unhappily and has a baby girl to look after. An unlikeable leading man makes this one day too many. It's impossible to say what type of movie One Day is. It postures as a comedy but it barely raises a single laugh. And though it also lacks dramatic impact for much of its length too, its one climax is so shocking and over the top that it will leave a sour taste in your mouth. Do not consider this as a date movie. You will not be popular. You also have to wonder late in the movie what the point was. Director Lone Scherfig (An Education, 2009) tries to end things on a very syrupy note. That's very nice for one of the characters but unrewarding for the audience who have waded through twenty years in the lives of these unappealing characters for nothing. The message is ultimately a very obvious, unoriginal and simple one: that life pulls people in opposite directions but happiness can be found in one single moment. Using an extended chronological structure is a gimmick. It allows for little on screen titles to appear in the frame, just like in (500) Days of Summer (2009) but it refuses to enrich character. A film like Blue Valentine (2010) is infinitively more intelligent because it realises that character is structure. It contrasts the past and present day to visualise the changing personalities of its leads and the impact on their relationship. The script by David Nicholls, adapting his own novel, lacks this kind of sophistication. Having the film move through such an extensive period suggests that there will be arching transformations in the characters. But unfortunately Sturgess remains continuously unlikeable all throughout this movie. His character is arrogant, rude, promiscuous and irresponsible. And briefly touching on his fractured relationship with his parents does not make him anymore sympathetic. Patricia Clarkson is barely in this movie because she has so few scenes and I wasn't moved by her appearances as the film intended. One of the golden rules of the romantic comedy is broken here: you don't understand why Emma and Dexter belong together. This is a detriment to the film's plotting and the motives of the characters. We're left wondering what this apparently sophisticated woman continues to see in this buffoon, especially when she's already with better company. Even after that huge climax Dexter still has a moment of madness. Only at the very end does he wake up to himself. The actors aren't really to blame. Anne Hathaway is such a pleasant actress in almost everything she does, comedy or otherwise. But this sketchy, underwritten role wastes her talents and doesn't stretch her chops at all. She's made to look dorky and uptight with her over-sized glasses, only to move into little but quirkiness. And Jim Sturgess who I liked in Across the Universe (2007) and The Way Back (2010) is gifted too, with no shortage of personality. He just happens to be playing a real jerk. If that's what he intended, he certainly succeeded. As far as the rebirth of frank romantic-comedies goes this is a pretty uninspired and limp entry.","9","24 August 2011"
"ianlouisiana","Here in the UK we call people like this ""Up themselves""and I can't think of a film where that description of the characters is more applicable.
One frankly poisonous bloke with his brains in his pants tries for 20 - odd years to seduce a girl he was at university with.
That,basically,is what ""One Day"" is all about.
It's not a love story for heaven sake,he is pathologically incapable of feeling so complex an emotion.
Except towards himself.
She wastes a significant proportion of her life waiting for him to change into a completely different person then,quite inexplicably decides she'll take him on as he is.Maybe she is hearing her biological clock.ticking.
Whatever,she dumps her French jazz pianist boyfriend so quickly he hardly has time to learn the melodic minor scale.
The device on which ""One Day"" hangs is so flimsy I lost interest very early on.
It might have been more winning if the writer had made the ""One Day"" the 29th February - at least it would have been over sooner.
All you need to know about the characters is that they play the terribly posh game ""Are you there,Moriarty"",an Oxbridge version of Blind Man's Buff with added violence .
Under the guise of which the seriously unpleasant guy smacks his girlfriend very hard in the face with a rolled up newspaper,causing her nose to bleed.
She(the lovely Romelai Garai - by far the best performance)still marries him and has his baby.
Well,I never said they were clever.","8","25 February 2018"
"chaz-28","There is a lingering and persistent distraction throughout One Day which severely impairs the audience from becoming absorbed in the film. This is Anne Hathaway's atrocious accent. Many Americans have at varying degrees in the past successfully pulled off a believable British accent. However, Anne Hathaway's character, Emma Morley, sounds at different times Irish, Scottish, and American, but never British. It truly was irritating after awhile. Why didn't the filmmakers just cast a British actress? Or, if they were dead set on Hathaway playing Emma, then move the whole story to America. If not for the distracting aural miscues, this film would most likely be much more enjoyable.Emma and Dexter (Jim Sturgess) meet the night of college graduation at the tail end of an all night party. This is not a meet-cute either. They are the only two left as the last couple pairs off with each other; therefore, fate has thrown them together to have a one night stand. Things get in the way and they end up deciding to be friends and start a very long platonic relationship. This is mostly convincing as Emma is seen to be truly infatuated with Dexter who does not see her in the same light, in fact, he treats her rather poorly as the years go by. Graduation night was July 15th by the way so naturally the pair concocts a plan to meet up annually on that day or at least check in my telephone if this is not possible.Surprisingly, every July 15th is actually a pretty horrible, sad day for each of them. Very rarely is one or both of them in a good mood and happy with where their life is at when the film jumps forward to another July 15th. Furthermore, the film focuses much more on Dexter than Emma with extensive scenes concerning his alcoholism and career missteps. Emma even authors a successful book and it hardly gets a mention until Dexter happens upon it. This made me wonder that if Dexter was to have so much more attention and screen time than Emma, why all the fuss to make Anne Hathaway British? Since the screenplay was written by the same gentlemen who wrote the novel this film is based on, the story's climax is inevitable even though it is forced and manipulative. The scene is also very poorly shot. The director, Lone Scherfig, who made the brilliant An Education two years ago, completely misses the mark with this scene and the rest of the film suffers for it. The event is set up in a way that even people who venture out and see one movie a year will be able to see what is coming up.Another miscue is Patricia Clarkson's role as Dexter's mother. It feels her role has been severely cut during the editing process. Not only does she have dialogue in the preview which is not in the movie, but she only shows up in about two-three scenes, moves the plot along, and then she's out of there. I have not read the novel, but I guarantee she is a much larger presence on those pages than what seems to be a faint echo of her in this movie.P.S. There is an atrocious Elvis Costello song over the closing credits which destroys any lingering fondness or afterthoughts the audience may have been enjoying during the closing scenes.","1","24 August 2011"
"Ali_John_Catterall","Yes, entirely predictably (well, you probably guessed as much from the trailer), they made an utter pig's ear of it. The Good:As Dex, Jim Sturgess is decent - nails the look, and the accent (both of them). Rafe Spall, as hapless wannabe comedian Ian is also fine - although there isn't a scintilla of genuine anguish about him when he's dumped, but hey, it's not his story right? (To be honest, it's a wonder they didn't simply represent him with a balloon on a stick.)It does have a few reflective moments of stillness, which are incredibly welcome - mostly concerning Dex and family (if the book was arguably slanted more towards Emma's side of the story, here it favours Dex) - but they're all too rare.The Bad:All too rare, because this one zips along like it's left the iron on (no mean feat in an 108 minute movie), galloping toward the denouement so that any emotional investment we might have made in it is almost completely wiped out. 1997, for example, literally lasts a swimming pool length. I know book-to-film adaptations bowdlerise to an extent, but this is absolutely ridiculous. There's also an argument to be made about the wisdom of letting writers adapt their own screenplays. Perhaps some sense of objectivity is lost in the process. Oddly enough, a previous David Nicholls' TV mini-series called 'I Saw You', starring Fay Ripley, is practically a warm-up for One Day, and is absolutely wonderful - very worth tracking down. That was in three parts. If the makers of One Day hadn't been so concerned with making a quick buck (usual story), this would have benefited from a mini-series of its own. But then, of course, there's no money in Telly.At its worst, the film's truncation manifests in a reliance on phone calls between the pair, which makes it seem as if Sturgess is frankly *stalking* Anne Hathaway. *That* twist, at least, is intact, and somewhat shocking. But in the same way a sudden glimpse of a mink being flayed alive in the middle of a Disney cartoon might be.Couldn't they have found one single British actress for crying out loud? Yes, I know only too well about the need for overseas investment. But you're not looking at Anne Hathaway thinking, 'working-class Northener' you're distractedly thinking, 'Isn't that... Anne Hathaway, working in a Tex Mex restaurant in Camden?'Romola Garai, who plays Sophie, would have done better - dressed-down a bit. (Or as often suggested, Carey Mulligan.) And how do they pull off Hathaway being only subtly attractive? Oversize specs. Because, you know, specs always make people look *dowdy*, apparently. I'm not even going to talk about her accent. You've heard it. It ranges from Angela's Ashes to... well, to Hathaway's own American accent, in fact.The Ugly:The more I think about this, the crosser I get. Film Emma never has any tawdry affairs, as in the novel, as it wouldn't suit her martyred character - and it wouldn't suit the fragrant Hathaway. A layered, interesting character becomes a 2-dimensional pouter; pure and nun-like. Just waiting around for Dexter to be ready, waiting for him to finally come around, and save her tormented soul. It's repulsive, actually - and *totally* a betrayal of her character and the spirit of the original. In short, it's not the very worst film in the world - it's just completely and utterly unremarkable; Sub-Richard Curtis, which is something this lovely and moving book just isn't.","9","19 August 2011"
"sdebord3136","I was pleasantly surprised by this film. I thought this was going to be another chick flick with a guy flirting with a girl but I found it was an amazing love story that spans 2 decades and gives a glimpse of what true love could really be. Anne H. was great for this because she is a timeless beauty that played her role through the years wonderfully, and Jim S. did a great job evolving with his character through immaturity to understanding. The European setting was beautiful and added to the scenes from the city to country side building the romance of it all.I wish I would have seen it sooner :)","8","20 November 2011"
"axxmy_one","People keep saying that movie adaptations from novels are usually not the same. Some are bad, some are okay, but in this case, it was beautiful. Lots of credit goes to David Nicholls for his excellent screenplay. Everything was PERFECT. Timeline, storyline and even the small details was well written. The acting was impeccable too. What about Anne Hathaway's accent? No problems there. Jim Sturgess plays the character Dexter perfectly. Most people would say that The Notebook is the top romantic teary eyed film. I tell them this: One Day is way better. It shows that two people can have friendship, loyalty, affection and love continuously. Watch it. Whether you have read the book or not, you will fall in love with Dexter & Emma !","6","24 November 2011"
"juneebuggy","I was a huge fan of the book by David Nicholls and really looked foreword to seeing this... And while it didn't quite live up to my expectations and somewhat failed to capture the love and tragedy of the novel it was still a decent enough romance.The lovely Jim Sturgess plays rich playboy Dexter, with the (mostly irritating) Anne Hathaway as working class woman Em. We join them in 1988 on the night of their college graduation where they almost get together, decide to be friends and then proceed to follow them over the course of the next two decades.We see them through assorted relationships, phone calls, fights, hopes, vacations, missed opportunities, laughter and tears. There is always the anticipation of, will these two ever get together? The tone of the movie is different than the book, trying to be a bit like 'When Harry Met Sally' and failing. I also didn't ever feel the connection between Dexter and Em. I guess I should stop comparing the two, apples and oranges and all that but when you adore a book as much as I did its hard.The ageing of the characters is very well done here, subtle but especially apparent at the very end when the movie flips back to the night they met and you go wow, look how young they were. The clothing is also true to the decade and there are some fun (bad) hairstyles. 1/4/15","10","1 April 2015"
"neil-476","I give advance notice that I am going to be spoilering fairly extensively as this review goes on: you have been warned. Spoiler-free synopsis: Emma and Dexter meet on the day they graduate from university (July 15th 1988): there is an instant connection, and they nearly do the deed, but not quite. Instead, they enter into a long-term friendship which we, the audience, look in on every year on the anniversary of their meeting. Without giving anything away at this point, Emma becomes a waitress and would-be author who takes up with an unsuccessful stand-up comedian, and Dexter becomes a promiscuous TV presenter. We can see that that, ideally, they should be together because Emma desperately loves Dexter, and would be able to turn him from the louche, dissolute rake he has become into the decent man he has the potential to be. But, as the years go by, they always shy away from it. Anne Hathaway plays Emma and Jim Sturgess plays Dexter.Let me comment on a couple of points frequently mentioned elsewhere. One, I had no problem with Anne Hathaway's accent. It was, mostly, a tolerable all purpose moderately well-spoken British accent, with occasional ""oop north"" flattened vowels unnecessarily thrown in. It didn't distract me. Two, I understand that the book is a big hit with a chunk of the audience (the cinema audience was mostly older women in pairs, some with husbands dragged along. I was the only solo male). I haven't read the book, so I have no comment as to how well the film represented it.This film irritated me. I recognise that I am not part of the target demographic for a romantic drama, but I can be reached: my tear glands are perfectly prepared to well up in appropriate circumstances. However, I left the cinema dry-eyed and stony-faced: this film did not touch me in the slightest.I think I was irritated with it right from the start. A young man, subsequently shown to be highly promiscuous, ends up in bed with a girl who is ready and willing, and then - nothing happens? No, I don't think so. From then onwards I was constantly aware of the attempted pushing of emotional manipulation buttons, and it just didn't work. I thought the acting was fine, the period atmosphere good despite the odd anachronism, but I couldn't see why these two totally dissimilar people were soulmates, nor why they kept in touch, what she saw in him - in short, nothing about the emotional side of the film worked for me at all.OK, now I'm going to get really spoilery. And then, after donkeys' years go by, and things go pear shaped for him, Dexter finally learns a bit of humility by which time Emma has found herself a French jazz pianist. She instantly dumps the poor pianist and takes up with Dexter. While trying for a baby of their own (he already has a daughter by a previous relationship), she - really, I'm warning you, stop reading now if you don't want to hit a B.I.G. spoiler - is killed in a traffic accident. We then enter the final section of the film which attempts to have its cake and eat it. Intercut with each other we see Dexter coming to terms with life after Emma's death, in touching (but all not that touching!) conversations with his daughter and Emma's old stand-up comedian boyfriend, plus we see a kind of re-set button version of the day Dexter and Emma first got together which leads us towards the more satisfying relationship they could have had/did have (?) For all these years.And that irritated me even more.I was never uninterested in what went on, but I should have been moved by this film, and I wasn't - and I think it is because it was full of emotional dishonesty from start to finish.","7","26 August 2011"
"jmc4769","I just got back home from seeing this movie, and I feel like I've been hit upside the head with a baseball bat. I'm a sucker for romantic movies, and I've sat through hundreds of mediocre ones that were watchable anyway. But One Day had to be one of the worst romance movies I have ever had the misfortune to endure. It was especially disappointing because I've loved Anne Hathaway in just about everything she's been in (Princess Diaries, Ella Enchanted, Rachel Getting Married, The Devil Wears Prada, Rio, etc.). One Day has few redeeming qualities, except for the occasional pretty scenery. The most serious problem is Jim Sturgess's character, Dexter. Dexter is an unlikable, shallow womanizer. I know what you're thinking: Charming womanizers are a staple of these movies. But Sturgess gives Dexter no charm, no glimmer of humanity, no hint that there may be lovable qualities beneath his contemptible persona. The usually wonderful Hathaway (Emma) gets mired down here in a bad script. And there is not the tiniest spark of chemistry between the two. I kept thinking, ""Come on, Emma, block this loser's number and take out a restraining order."" When the inevitable romance comes, it hasn't a shred of believability. This movie ultimately amounts to a plain Jane wish-fulfillment fantasy (yep, Hathaway is supposed to be plain)...sort of like those movies where the nerdy guy gets the hot girl. The plot structure is a big problem too. We see the main characters only on one day (July 15th) of every year from 1988 to 2011. Instead of continuity, character development, and relationship development, we get mostly uninteresting snippets of their lives. The final straw for me though was the surprise ending, which was a completely gratuitous attempt to insert meaningful drama into an otherwise vacuous movie. At this point, I was begging for the movie to be over, but no such luck. Incredibly, screenwriter (and author of the book of the same name), David Nicholls, drags this bad movie out for another 15 minutes or so.","10","19 August 2011"
"851222","Greetings from Lithuania.I don't watch romantic movies often, but when i heard about story of ""One day"" i thought of giving it a chance. And it sure didn't disappoint me. This is a really good love story, told in a single day in a year in period of 23 years. Movie is beautifully filmed, with great acting by the two leads, especially from Anne Hathaway. She's just so ... beautiful in every meaning of this word. Can't wait to see her next summer in ""TDKR"". ""One day"" isn't your typical Hollywood love story and you can clearly FEEL that watching it. Give this movie a chance and you can be really surprised that when this movie will end, you'll fell your self a little ... brighter.","9","16 October 2011"
"achyutaghosh","Disclaimer first up- biased review, as I am a sucker for love stories.I used to think that Hollywood had stopped making emotionally involving love stories. Thank god they made One Day, then. Based on the best selling book by British author Dave Nicholls, the movie explores the intertwined lives of two protagonists of contrasting nature, yet fated to be together. The premise is novel, with the relationship explored though a peek into 15th July of each year, spread over 22 years. Good stories are brought to life by good acting, and here we have two superb exponents in lead roles- Jim Sturgess as Dexter and Anna Hathaway as Emma. Dexter leads the high profile life, a television anchor with success in all forms chasing him, always. But then his life is also hollow, his friends shallow, and in the end, a faces disillusionment and compromise. Emma dwells in obscurity mostly, but through sheer tenacity and belief achieves a modicum of success as a writer. They meet when they are 18, decide to remain lifelong friends, and they do remain so. In the meanwhile meandering through the vagaries of life, they are inexorably drawn towards each other, dependent on each other.Childhood sweethearts, even if long lost, when they do come together, they do get together without any questions asked- i say this having witnessed the same on a close friend of mine. And you cant help but fall in love with Emma and Dexter- their love story is so compelling and adorable, that you become a part of their story, you care for them, you laugh with them, and also cry, you want them to do what you would do, and yes, you desperately want a happy ending for them.And of course there is Anna Hathaway-suitably rumpled and grunge in the first half, and elegance and grace personified in the second, when she flashes her pearly whites, the world seems to be a better place to live.Why do people in love get to be in love in the best of locations? One Day happens in picturesque Edinburgh, colourful London, and stylish Paris. And the best thing that makes it stand out among all love stories is that it is not predictable, till the very end. People and things change with time, but memories remain the same.- here's a movie that raises a toast to happy memories, a Must watch for mushy folks!","9","23 November 2011"
"Philby-3","One Day Two eighties graduates in Edinburgh have an encounter on graduation day, July 15th ; the film follows their relationship by annual updates. Dexter (Jim Sturgess) brilliant, charismatic and a total narcissist and Emma (Ann Hathaway), a demure, warm sort are not a great match and both hitch up with others, but their friendship endures.The film is romantic, but only to a point, and can hardly be described as a comedy; there is too much pain for that, despite some funny dialogue. It is a kind of growing older movie – early promise turning sour, bright young ambitious things tasting failure and settling for something less. The story is cleverly told and nicely shot, with good support from Ken Stott and Patricia Clarkson as Dexter's disapproving parents and Rhys Spall as Emma's husband. Jim Sturgess looks and acts uncannily like a younger Rupert Graves, who has portrayed a long line of charming handsome wastrels. Ann Hathaway might be from New York but she plays Emma perfectly – the dialect coaches really earned their money. Both of the principals manage to evoke our sympathy, though Sturgess has the harder job.July 15 is St Swithin's day. On that day in 1415 the English Army led by Henry V (alias Laurence Olivier or Kenneth Branagh) defeated a larger French force at Agincourt. This has absolutely nothing to do with the movie though Dexter and Emma do at one stage venture to Brittany, where they manage to lose their clothes in one of the film's more comedic moments.I couldn't help feeling the story arc was rather predictable but I was absorbed nonetheless. At the end I'm not sure what the attraction was for Emma – she was smart enough to realise Dexter was a jerk but somehow she couldn't resist. He does get better – perhaps deep down she wanted to reform him. Or perhaps deep down she wanted to be a bit wild too. A film for generation Xers who are wondering what the hell happened to their youthful dreams and plans.","4","14 September 2011"
"napierslogs","""One Day"", based on the novel of the same name, is the relationship of two people, Emma (Anne Hathaway) and Dexter (Jim Sturgess), as we see it on July 15th of each year. As can be expected from the nature of the story, it's a little dry, lacking in comedy. But then again, it's a romantic drama, not a romantic comedy.As is the nature of the two media, movies can never be exactly the same as the novel. But the problem with this one is that they tried to; no story lines were removed. Almost everything was there, just shortened into mostly meaningless segments. I personally could have done with one less event in their lives, and perhaps a different ending, but they tried to be as faithful as possible.What we have here is a movie about a relationship, but the novel was about the people. They traded in character depth and development so we can see them in their more attractive years falling in and out of love.I wasn't very familiar with Jim Sturgess, having seen him play skinny, slightly nerdy, not as confident kids. Dexter is a different breed of guy. Just has high on self-confidence as he is on drugs and alcohol, he gets by on his looks – literally – he's a TV host. Although the different characteristics of Dexter weren't explicitly shown in the movie, Sturgess brought them out in him perfectly. Emma is a more complex character, with significant evolution to who she is throughout the years, except none of that is in the movie, so it just wasn't really possible for Hathaway to portray her as a more interesting person.I would assume that watching ""One Day"" without the benefit of having read the novel would be a fairly confusing, empty experience. With the background that the novel gave me, I could fill in all the missing years and the unexplored layers to the characters, so there was still something to their relationship for me.","5","19 August 2011"
"TheBobbyjames","Very seldom in Hollywood are movies produced that are as emotionally involving as 'One Day.' It's a beautiful, beautiful love story of two people, Emma (Anne Hathaway) and Dex (Jim Sturgess). After spending the night together after graduation, we are taken on a journey into their lives for one day each year after they met; to see where they are or where they're not. Based on the book by David Nicholls (who also wrote the screenplay), 'One Day' transitions from novel to film brilliantly.First let me say film acting is what I believe makes or breaks a movie - if the actors are great, the movie is generally great. That's not to take away from any other element of film at all, but when everything else is done so well, if the acting were bad, the film would have been less memorable. But Anne Hathaway and Jim Sturgess are so very impressive here. They make their characters real and relatable, which are two key things every actor internally wishes they could do. In fact, as an on-screen pair, they work extremely well, together they exude chemistry.What I found most interesting about the entire experience was that I cared so much. I became enamoured with their lives. I kept hoping for the best. I anticipated what would happen to each of them. I sat forward, sat backward. I laughed and I cried. I've said many times before, a great movie will effect you emotionally in more ways than one. You'll be angry, you'll be happy, you'll be sad - the key is that you emote. This movie presented all of those elements. It was fresh and witty and everything you hope a movie will be. It's as beautifully made as it is acted and the locations are exquisite. Far too often, characters in Hollywood seem contrived and are not genuine. 'One Day' is honestly one of the most genuine stories ever told - there is no instant gratification, there is however frustration and that is the beauty of it all. It explores love and love lost, it explores friendship and the constraints of time and distance. It explores each character's journey to happiness and the trials they face along the way. So many little pieces of the puzzle are filled in between the years by simple, single lines of dialogue or actions. It's not the typical script of ""everything's all good-obstacle-everything ends well"" - there's a lot more complexity which makes it realistically genuine.So many little details, like eye-lines, smiles, sighs, cut-off conversations, etc. were paid attention to. The costuming, cinematography and score were spot on and all noteworthy. All of it combined was moving and awe-inspiring. I left the theater crying, but it didn't stop there, even thinking about the movie and those characters is deeply affecting. Maybe there are some underlying themes in the film that I'm identifying with, or maybe, just maybe the actors were really that great. Whatever it is, this film comes with my highest recommendation, is rated PG-13 and runs 107 minutes.","9","31 August 2011"
"TheLittleSongbird","The book was a wonderful read. One Day was a movie I was looking forward to, and while it was disappointing I found it very pleasant.What made the book so good and such a joy to read was not just the emotional impact, modern angst and characterisation but also how nostalgic it made me. The emotional impact and angst is here in the movie, what wasn't quite there was the nostalgia-evidence of it but could've been more- and characterisation which does feel choppy especially with Patricia Clarkson's Alison though Dexter is well realised.That said, I loved the beautiful look of the film, the soundtrack which gave the film its sense of nostalgia and the witty banter between Sturgess and Hathaway. The romantic elements are touching though the comedic elements don't always work coming across as a tad contrived. The direction is decent, the telling of the story is well paced(if somewhat glacial) and faithful and the script has some nice touches but also some weak ones. Of the support performances I thought Rafe Spall, Romola Garai and Ken Stott were the most effective and Clarkson was good if deserving of more to do. The picture belongs to Jim Sturgess, while staying true to his bad boy character of Dexter he also manages to be sympathetic.My feelings on Anne Hathaway were mixed. I loved her radiance and her chemistry with Sturgess, but her accent was inconsistent and felt forced and unnatural whenever she tried it. The shock ending also felt more bewildering than anything else, not the actual tragedy itself but rather the flashbacks that succeeded that I wasn't sure was really needed.In conclusion, pleasant if not entirely successful. 6.5/10 Bethany Cox","7","31 August 2011"
"JimmyCollins","Words cannot describe how wonderful an actress Anne Hathaway is, and in One Day she is in fine form, if there ever was an actress to go down in the history books among the greats it would be her. Jim Sturgess is quite a charming devil swell.The story that takes place in One Day is at moments the anti love story and other times a sweeping epic romance, even though this movie has been adapted from a book it's still a lot more original than other romantic themed films of late. Lone Scherfig definitely suits this style of English romance, starting with An Education and now this, it may sound mean but I just don't think the romantic dramas that come from the U.S have the same genuine feel that the English films do.I had read the book and i have to say that this is a very loyal adaptation, much of the beauty from the book is clear and present here, particularly the friendship aspect between Dex and Emma, in the book it's a quirky kind of friendship and it transferred well on the screen as, I was very pleased that the film makers didn't ruin that with a cheap silly sexual type of friendship.I could say a lot about how lovely this movie is but I think I'll let everyone make up their own mind. A lot of people have a bad opinion of this movie which I find baffling but I suppose each to their own, I just got totally wrapped up in this gorgeous romance.10 out of 10","8","3 September 2011"
"queen_of_naboo88","I went to see One Day last night, and though I had been looking forward to it for a while, I was surprised at how good it actually is. The film has a very unique atmosphere, as it is much quirkier than your average romance. Also, without giving away the ending, I can say that it isn't as predictable as one might think. What I really liked about it was the complexity of the different human relationships that we are shown. The relationship between Emma and Dexter is by no means an easy one, nor is it one-sided. Given how different they are, there is a lot of conflict between them, although they do love each other. Similarly, what Dexter and his ex-wife feel for one another is never pure hatred, but there is a lot of understanding between them. As a consequence, the story seems like it could be taken from real life. Plus, both Hathaway and Sturgess are as convincing as always, which makes this film absolutely worth seeing.","7","19 August 2011"
"guest_pabby","After perusing other reviews for this movie, I believe that many of the ratings are low, not because viewers disliked the movie, but because they disliked the element in which the film shines. The film succeeds in drawing the audience into the friendship between the main characters, played by Jim Sturgess and Anne Hathaway. Both characters find happiness and meaning in parts of their lives, while suffering through other portions without attaining goals they've set for themselves; i.e., this is real life.What the poorly-rating reviewers seek is escapism. In my view--however limited--this film aims to depict two human beings as they learn, grow, and fall in and out of touch with one another. Thus, don't expect any fairy tales here and don't punish the rating on this movie because it isn't a fairy tale! A predictable conclusion to this movie would place Sturgess and Hathaway side by side, married, and living together untouched by the trials of a realistic relationship. Instead, the director effectively and with calculation showcases some of life in the scenes and merely hints at events not shown on the screen. As the film narrates exclusively through one date each year (hence, the name), partial narratives are expected. The final third of the film, shunned by a few reviewers, elevated the creative vision of the story because it introduces the unpredictable nature of real life into a movie that was otherwise a run-of-the-mill romance. Again, speaking in terms of the development between characters, the movie is above average. Speaking in terms of storyline, the first two-thirds, to a certain degree, lack what the final third delivers: surprise! The juxtaposition of the present with the past near the end of this film makes the events even more potent than they would have been. Audience members who do not fall into the ""half-wit"" category can follow the story, regardless of what the viewers who read the novel state in their reviews. Bravo! Lastly, Anne Hathaway is exceedingly lovely.","4","3 September 2011"
"ferguson-6","Greetings again from the darkness. I have not read David Nicholls' novel, but my understanding is that it is extremely well written and its loyal readers really connected with Emma and Dexter. If that's true, then this film version is even worse than I thought while watching.This literally is my least favorite type of movie. A movie that assumes its viewers are unable to think for themselves or judge the actions of its characters. In other words, the filmmakers take for granted that we will accept whatever is shown on the big screen.First let me say that I completely understand the school girl crush that a young Emma (Anne Hathaway) has on her classmate Dexter (Jim Sturgess). He is handsome and charismatic and comes from more money than she. I also understand Dexter's attraction to the lovely Emma. She is very pretty - despite the ridiculous over-sized glasses for the early scenes - and very intelligent, and a significantly nicer person than he.What makes absolutely no sense to me is her continued attraction to this drunken, empty soul for the next twenty years. She is too smart to pine away the years hoping he will wise up and coming running to her. We are supposed to believe that she has no interest in any other relationship other than the non-threatening one with flopping stand-up comedian Ian (played by Timothy Spall's son Rafe) and a ""boring"" French Jazz Pianist.Dexter's mother is played by Patricia Clarkson. As she is dying from cancer, she tells him that she believes he will grow into a good man, but isn't there yet. I guess we are supposed to take her word for it. Instead we only see Dexter go from a selfish pig as a TV personality to a defeated man who must perform manual labor for the first time in his life. My issue is that a defeated man is not necessarily a good man. A man resigned to his life has not necessarily reached enlightenment. Where is Emma's proof that he deserves her? Where is the indication that her life with him will be better? I tell you where ... in the mind of that school girl from years ago.Please don't mistake my words as that of one who has no faith in romantic stories. There are so many ways this story could have turned that it would have had me. Instead it chose a path that assumed I was ignorant ... totally accepting of ridiculous story being laid out for me.My final comments on the film involve the cast. Anne Hathaway is an incredibly talented performer. She is not, however, British. Her accent is terribly distracting. Jim Sturgess is a handsome guy, but just not charismatic enough to pull off the TV personality role. Patricia Clarkson is a fantastic actress, but she is not British either. Seriously, are there not enough British actresses? The casting smells like a money-grubbing production team. As for director Lone Scherfig ... her previous film An Education was cinematic excellence. This is an unacceptable follow-up and we expect better next time.I will say the locations of Edinburg, London and Paris were beautiful and different than we usually get from the movies. That provided the only real enjoyment from this highly disappointing movie.","3","21 August 2011"
"Rob-O-Cop","this had some great aspects to it but ultimately failed to deliver. Firstly the good. Brilliant locations, beautiful cinematography, Anne Hathaway delivers a good performance,The bad. The editor and the director failed to establish a believable connection between the two lead actors as to why they would form a lasting bond that would carry them over 20 years. We're given a hint of this at the end but that doesn't help or fix the rest of the movie, so that's the bad editing aspect of this. if this scene had been at the front it might have helped sell the movie. That that scene didn't really deliver the goods needed to make it believable is the directors mistake along with many of the other scenes that tips the scale against the characters. Too many scenes of Dexter being a jerk and not enough of him being in anyway lovable or charming, even though there was much amusement to be had in the jerk Dexter scenes they blew out the balance of his character and it wasn't till the end that we got to see him as anything less than a jerk, but by then it was too late and it didn't really do anything to alter the confusion of why Emma would have cared. I also didn't buy Jim Sturgess performance, although a lot of people think differently, he came across as a caricature rather than a character. People have criticised Anne Hathaway's accent and there's probably some weight to that but I personally didn't find it annoying once I thought what's going on with her accent as it fluctuated all over the show. That's a continuity and a direction flaw as much as it is her performance. After a few mins I put it in the multi-sourced accent file as many people have blended accents. Outside of that Anne's delivering some really good depth in her work so much so that we may one day forgive her for the princess diaries.","3","27 January 2012"
"francine-k","I had watched ""One Day"" yesterday and was beyond excited because I had read the novel by David Nicholls, which was fantastic. The movie base's around 2 people and their twenty years together, shown only through one day, July 15th. I thought the plot was unique and was a very realistic romance. Sometimes it takes people a lot to lose to realize what life is about, and how certain people are truly important to you. The movie was cute, funny, and quite sad at times. I thought Anne Hathaway did an okay job on the accent, to me it was odd at first but after a couple minutes I had gotten used to it. Her acting was great and you can really see her changing as the years progress. Jim Sturgess was great and in my opinion really portrayed Dexter the best as possible, with the arrogance and attitude exactly as I imagined Dexter would have. In my own opinion the movie was a great watch, was a romance that I had been dying for ever sense The Notebook. Finally a tear jerking but smile at the end movie, that really anyone can enjoy, if your looking for a romance movie.","8","20 August 2011"
"JohnDeSando","One Day is promoted as drama romance and not a rom com. On all three counts I would call it out anyway, for it is a melodramatic, episodic tale of two best friends in London, Emma (Anne Hathaway) and Dexter (Jim Sturgess), who flirt with love over a long period but play on the standard cliché that requires they eventually end up together, regardless how many marriages and children intervene.One Day has too many short episodes from college in the '80's until professional life in 2011, and each seems just a variation on another before it: boy gets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl back again, well, you know the routine. During all these little skirmishes Emma remains wholesome (no stretch for the perpetually cute Hathaway, reminding me of Sally Hawkins' Poppy in Mike Leigh's Happy Go Lucky. But without Hawkins' charisma).Dexter is a cad and Lothario almost all the way, making him unlikeable and difficult to gain our sympathy. His cavalier treatment of his mother (the ever-interesting Patricia Clarkson) and father (Ken Stott) adds to his surly persona. In addition, Sturgess needs a little coaching or better script if he wishes to catch up with the Ryans (Gosling and Reynolds) in the emerging leading-man lineup.Nowhere do I feel a real sexual heat, especially since in most of the film they are avowing to be just friends. Moreover in the numerous years/episodes I do not feel the intellectual and emotional connection that comes so naturally in Richard Linklater's Before Sunrise/Sunset series. Even director Lone Scherfig's Parisian scenes are vacant, poor cousins to Woody Allen's romantic City of Lights in Midnight in Paris.As an Anglophile, I usually can forgive many sins if a film gives me an adequate dose of the great city, but as with the Paris background, romance takes a holiday even from the cities.","10","23 August 2011"
"blanbrn","Over the summer I saw this film sure it's typical chick flick, still as a male I admire the beauty and sexy look of Anne Hathaway who I think is a brilliant actress. Plus I think she pulled the international accent off just fine in this film and as always her look is sharp and just fine. This is a love story that spans time with memories these moments touch you staying with you forever despite when an unexpected tragedy strikes.Set in England it involves a couple Em(Anne Hathaway) and Dexter(Jim Sturgess) and after this international couple graduates from college and meet and fall for one another on July 15, 1989. From every year on on this date it's considered an anniversary for this couple as the film shows the special moments that happened during the lives of both. As each year on the same day is highlighted you see that no matter what path their lives have taken love and memories draw them together.Overall this is a film of memory and everlasting love sadly an unexpected tragedy occurs, but still with memories Dexter will love Em forever as long as memories are around love can last forever. Probably not a great film but worth a watch for any Anne Hathaway fan.","9","10 October 2011"
"jeffallenhammer","Does life imitate art or does art imitate life? I'm one who tends to avoid the discussion entirely by saying ""both."" One Day is the most real (save a few accents) movie I've seen in a long time. It explores time and how it often slips away from us. Our hearts' desires are often decimated by bad timing, and the movie finds a variety of ways to demonstrate this. So in the case of One Day, art imitates life to the fullest, as we can all sympathize (if only a little) to crushed hopes and shattered dreams, though hopefully we eventually find our way.Anne Hathaway stars as insecure working-class woman Emma, who, for one reason or another is drawn to Dexter, (Jim Sturgess) a charming upper middle class man with a great amount of self-confidence. It may be hard to understand just what the two have on each other, but they are characters I'm familiar with. The woman who is way too into a man that's way too into himself, it happens and for the type, Dex is pretty likable. Em and Dex have nothing in common. But their opposite personalities do what a relationship should; make each other better. They are Yin and Yang, complementary opposites.An interesting technique used by One Day, is that we only get to see the events of a single day, July 15, for each of 20 plus years. Some of my peers have taken to calling this a gimmick. In a year where it seems every other film is either a sequel or a remake/reboot, (which critics and public alike have grown tired of) I feel fresh ideas should be applauded, even if it doesn't quite work. For me, however, it worked to perfection. Director Lone Scherfig (An Education) paints the picture of Em and Dex's up and down relationship with great finesse, never having too much happen on the date year to year. The filmmaker fills us in on what has taken place throughout each year, without conversations seeming inorganic. The cinematography is beautiful, especially a scene where our would-be lovers break all their rules by taking a dip at sunset. There's plenty of humor, joy, sadness, regret and a number of other emotions to be felt. I caution viewers that this isn't a romantic comedy, nor does it end like one. One Day is, however, easily one of the most heartfelt films of the year and should be celebrated for its bravery.","8","31 August 2011"
"fernandoschiavi","Based on David Nichols' bestseller, ""One Day"" is a more mature Nicholas Sparks version, but equally tearful and melodramatic. Based on a peculiar and intriguing narrative structure, which revisits the 15th of July in the lives of Dexter and Emma since 1988 over more than 20 years, the story focuses on the maturation of the relationship between its characters, fleeing the punctuality and immediacy that surrounds most novels. Ironically, this same artifice reveals the main weakness of the script - others will be seen in the following paragraphs - because the annual reunion with the characters does not hide the considerable loss of information that motivated sudden changes in the life and behavior of each one.Sensitively directed by the Danish Lone Scherfig (""Education""), who delicately builds the fluid dynamic between Dexter and Emma (Hathaway), One Day is skillful in establishing the passage of time also with the aid of an impeccable make-up job - and notice how Sturgess, in particular, goes from a smooth-faced, jovial boy to a weary middle-aged man with wrinkles and bags under his eyes, while Hathaway emerges chubby (but not exaggeratedly so) after working two years as a waitress in a Mexican restaurant, which is an interesting detail. Benefiting from a competent cast that creates equally complex secondary characters that help compose the journey of the main couple (worth mentioning Rafe Spall, son of Timothy, who transforms the aspiring comedian Ian into a man that is simultaneously pathetic and moving), the film fails here and there by investing in stereotyped characterizations, but still avoiding that they dominate the narrative - and if Dexter's father appears as the typical ""cold and critical father"", Ken Stott manages to make him softer through occasional hesitations that point out his internal effort to try to get closer to the child.Likewise, if Nicholls' dialogues are occasionally forced to appeal to exposition in order to clarify what happened to the characters in the previous year, this is balanced by the good construction of so many other lines (especially those spoken by Hathaway), which they display the cold irony typical of British humor (Emma at one point describes the restaurant where she works as a ""graveyard of ambitions""). As if that were not enough, the script also creates really sensitive interactions between those people, highlighting the brief and beautiful scene between Dexter and his mother, who, played by Patricia Clarkson, shows melancholy and love when telling her son that, even certain that he will be a good man, realizes that he ""isn't there yet"".The dialogues are a strong point of the script, also written by David Nicholls. They are fast, with intelligent insights and manage to perfectly translate the personality of each character and their relationships with each other. Even with silly jokes, like Dexter's mother in Paris saying to her son, ""look over there, Alain Delon"" ... or not, it's your father"", demonstrating how much she is in love with her husband. There are funny scenes too, like when Dexter plays the most famous scene of Spartacus with the dolls for his daughter. But no character is better translated by the dialogues than Emma, the shy girl, but extremely intelligent and sagacious. Each of her lines is a bit of her temperament, feeling, spontaneity.However, it is even in the construction of Dexter and Emma that ""One Day"" proves to be particularly efficient: while the boy quickly achieves professional success, the girl struggles for years trying to make her artistic aspirations viable - a situation that gradually reverses as that we perceive that the former lacks the intellectual, emotional and psychological content that sustains his career, while Emma, growing from suffering, reflection and the simple experience of life, gradually transforms herself into a mature woman and ready to overcome the obstacles that previously prevented it from moving forward (and Sturgess and Hathaway, talented and charismatic, confidently illustrate these changes).The problem is that Hathaway's character quickly becomes the link with the audience. The dreamy sweetness, the sweetness and the detachment transform Emma into a very pleasant company, something that Dexter cannot see. Unsympathetic, self-centered and narcissistic, he uses Emma more as someone to quench the loneliness caused by her personality and assuage her pain and addictions than as a true friendship. Played by the expressionless Sturgess and his characteristic face of suffering, it is practically impossible to believe the beautiful and sensitive Emma fell in love with the guy after a disastrous dinner in which he exposes her (dis)interest. In this way, she emerges as the tragic anchor of the narrative, surrendering herself to the loves of a person she does not love, just to fill the sentimental need. What is revealed in the most cliché of sentences, enunciated according to the Nicholas Sparks booklet: ""she made him decent; you made her happy"".As Emma and Dexter mature, the adolescent, dreamy and inconsequential traits give way to realistic, cynical and disillusioned versions, propelled by tragedies, some of them approached with excessive disregard and disengagement due to the narrative structure - yet another negative effect of this. Elevated to the status of protagonist, an incorrect and questionable decision, Dexter undergoes a wide dramatic arc from his mother's illness (Clarkson), the cancellation of the television program, his marriage to Sylvie (Romola Garai, the young woman from ""Desire and Reparation"" and increasingly better actress), to an event that would definitely humanize him. At times, Emma's life is described in terms of her dream of becoming a writer or her relationship with Ian (Rafe Spall), which is disappointing.By scrutinizing and dissecting fractions of those characters' lives, certain moments should be more appropriately explored in David Nicholls' script. Dexter's firing after a botched interview and being hired on a video game show lacks a glimpse into the character's journey, though we understand what led to this precipitous fall. Similarly, Emma's relationship with Ian, presented at a dinner party without sparks or the guy's inability to make jokes, culminates in the explanation that she can't ""take him watching Wrath of Khan every day anymore"". This excessive exposition becomes constant in the film, requiring that a character needs to contextualize the events that are taking place to the public, which exposes the artificiality of the undertaking; well, if Emma and Dexter are such good friends, it was expected that he would reveal the bad news in the expected time and not months later.On the other hand, the annual narrative is well explored by Danish director Lone Scherfig, and the use of raccords and ellipses in Barney Pilling's montage stands out. And not just temporality, but the duo of characters allows Benoît Delhomme's photography to individualize Emma's trajectory in a nostalgic sepia, while Dexter is bathed in a depressing bluish color palette. Finally, Rachel Portman's score avoids being too intrusive, competently punctuating the narrative. Yes, the idea is curious and the narrative exercise valid (albeit flawed). The trajectory of two people is drawn before our eyes and, let's face it, it's not something usual in novel production. It is a pity, therefore, that the chosen 15th of July sounds hopelessly clichéd and expositional, making the unknown 364 remaining days of each year seem more interesting by comparison.We cannot, however, say that the film is not romantic. It has its moments, even if it prepares us to tears in such an obvious and brief way. Soon we will be in the next year, and the year after that, forgetting the pain and moving on. But that doesn't stop us from living in the moment. They are brief, it is true, but true and well-constructed. Especially in the final act, where we desperately want to go back to the beginning, as an attempt to remake the story, or at least fool our minds with that simple encounter in the middle of the street and a kiss seals the love story that should have been. Director Lone Scherfig managed to bring delicacy to the story of Emma and Dexter, making ""One Day"" a sensitive film. A love story built without resources common to films of this nature. Everything is almost realistic and fearful as life. She regrets that, when the situation picks up, she pulls the rug out from under us, with a cliché situation, announced, made just to make us cry. And she didn't even make it. Still, a good movie of its kind.","1","12 May 2023"
"Likes_Ninjas90","In the late 80s a girl named Emma (Anne Hathaway) is a college student who meets fellow graduate Dexter (Jim Sturgess). They're about to sleep together one evening but decide to remain friends instead. Over the course of twenty years we see how circumstances and other people have kept them divided when they just want to be together. Dexter finds himself hosting a ghastly television show, while being warned by his sick mother (Patricia Clarkson) that he isn't a particularly nice person anymore. He insists that he just wants to have fun, despite being critically panned and moving between women. Emma works her way up from a job in a fast food restaurant, to a teacher and then eventually into a successful author. To the distress of Dexter she has a serious relationship with an obnoxious comedian, which puts her real desires on hold. Late in the timeline, Dexter is married rather unhappily and has a baby girl to look after. An unlikeable leading man makes this one day too many. It's impossible to say what type of movie One Day is. It postures as a comedy but it barely raises a single laugh. And though it also lacks dramatic impact for much of its length too, its one climax is so shocking and over the top that it will leave a sour taste in your mouth. Do not consider this as a date movie. You will not be popular. You also have to wonder late in the movie what the point was. Director Lone Scherfig (An Education, 2009) tries to end things on a very syrupy note. That's very nice for one of the characters but unrewarding for the audience who have waded through twenty years in the lives of these unappealing characters for nothing. The message is ultimately a very obvious, unoriginal and simple one: that life pulls people in opposite directions but happiness can be found in one single moment. Using an extended chronological structure is a gimmick. It allows for little on screen titles to appear in the frame, just like in (500) Days of Summer (2009) but it refuses to enrich character. A film like Blue Valentine (2010) is infinitively more intelligent because it realises that character is structure. It contrasts the past and present day to visualise the changing personalities of its leads and the impact on their relationship. The script by David Nicholls, adapting his own novel, lacks this kind of sophistication. Having the film move through such an extensive period suggests that there will be arching transformations in the characters. But unfortunately Sturgess remains continuously unlikeable all throughout this movie. His character is arrogant, rude, promiscuous and irresponsible. And briefly touching on his fractured relationship with his parents does not make him anymore sympathetic. Patricia Clarkson is barely in this movie because she has so few scenes and I wasn't moved by her appearances as the film intended. One of the golden rules of the romantic comedy is broken here: you don't understand why Emma and Dexter belong together. This is a detriment to the film's plotting and the motives of the characters. We're left wondering what this apparently sophisticated woman continues to see in this buffoon, especially when she's already with better company. Even after that huge climax Dexter still has a moment of madness. Only at the very end does he wake up to himself. The actors aren't really to blame. Anne Hathaway is such a pleasant actress in almost everything she does, comedy or otherwise. But this sketchy, underwritten role wastes her talents and doesn't stretch her chops at all. She's made to look dorky and uptight with her over-sized glasses, only to move into little but quirkiness. And Jim Sturgess who I liked in Across the Universe (2007) and The Way Back (2010) is gifted too, with no shortage of personality. He just happens to be playing a real jerk. If that's what he intended, he certainly succeeded. As far as the rebirth of frank romantic-comedies goes this is a pretty uninspired and limp entry.","9","24 August 2011"
"ianlouisiana","Here in the UK we call people like this ""Up themselves""and I can't think of a film where that description of the characters is more applicable.
One frankly poisonous bloke with his brains in his pants tries for 20 - odd years to seduce a girl he was at university with.
That,basically,is what ""One Day"" is all about.
It's not a love story for heaven sake,he is pathologically incapable of feeling so complex an emotion.
Except towards himself.
She wastes a significant proportion of her life waiting for him to change into a completely different person then,quite inexplicably decides she'll take him on as he is.Maybe she is hearing her biological clock.ticking.
Whatever,she dumps her French jazz pianist boyfriend so quickly he hardly has time to learn the melodic minor scale.
The device on which ""One Day"" hangs is so flimsy I lost interest very early on.
It might have been more winning if the writer had made the ""One Day"" the 29th February - at least it would have been over sooner.
All you need to know about the characters is that they play the terribly posh game ""Are you there,Moriarty"",an Oxbridge version of Blind Man's Buff with added violence .
Under the guise of which the seriously unpleasant guy smacks his girlfriend very hard in the face with a rolled up newspaper,causing her nose to bleed.
She(the lovely Romelai Garai - by far the best performance)still marries him and has his baby.
Well,I never said they were clever.","8","25 February 2018"
"chaz-28","There is a lingering and persistent distraction throughout One Day which severely impairs the audience from becoming absorbed in the film. This is Anne Hathaway's atrocious accent. Many Americans have at varying degrees in the past successfully pulled off a believable British accent. However, Anne Hathaway's character, Emma Morley, sounds at different times Irish, Scottish, and American, but never British. It truly was irritating after awhile. Why didn't the filmmakers just cast a British actress? Or, if they were dead set on Hathaway playing Emma, then move the whole story to America. If not for the distracting aural miscues, this film would most likely be much more enjoyable.Emma and Dexter (Jim Sturgess) meet the night of college graduation at the tail end of an all night party. This is not a meet-cute either. They are the only two left as the last couple pairs off with each other; therefore, fate has thrown them together to have a one night stand. Things get in the way and they end up deciding to be friends and start a very long platonic relationship. This is mostly convincing as Emma is seen to be truly infatuated with Dexter who does not see her in the same light, in fact, he treats her rather poorly as the years go by. Graduation night was July 15th by the way so naturally the pair concocts a plan to meet up annually on that day or at least check in my telephone if this is not possible.Surprisingly, every July 15th is actually a pretty horrible, sad day for each of them. Very rarely is one or both of them in a good mood and happy with where their life is at when the film jumps forward to another July 15th. Furthermore, the film focuses much more on Dexter than Emma with extensive scenes concerning his alcoholism and career missteps. Emma even authors a successful book and it hardly gets a mention until Dexter happens upon it. This made me wonder that if Dexter was to have so much more attention and screen time than Emma, why all the fuss to make Anne Hathaway British? Since the screenplay was written by the same gentlemen who wrote the novel this film is based on, the story's climax is inevitable even though it is forced and manipulative. The scene is also very poorly shot. The director, Lone Scherfig, who made the brilliant An Education two years ago, completely misses the mark with this scene and the rest of the film suffers for it. The event is set up in a way that even people who venture out and see one movie a year will be able to see what is coming up.Another miscue is Patricia Clarkson's role as Dexter's mother. It feels her role has been severely cut during the editing process. Not only does she have dialogue in the preview which is not in the movie, but she only shows up in about two-three scenes, moves the plot along, and then she's out of there. I have not read the novel, but I guarantee she is a much larger presence on those pages than what seems to be a faint echo of her in this movie.P.S. There is an atrocious Elvis Costello song over the closing credits which destroys any lingering fondness or afterthoughts the audience may have been enjoying during the closing scenes.","6","24 August 2011"
"Ali_John_Catterall","Yes, entirely predictably (well, you probably guessed as much from the trailer), they made an utter pig's ear of it. The Good:As Dex, Jim Sturgess is decent - nails the look, and the accent (both of them). Rafe Spall, as hapless wannabe comedian Ian is also fine - although there isn't a scintilla of genuine anguish about him when he's dumped, but hey, it's not his story right? (To be honest, it's a wonder they didn't simply represent him with a balloon on a stick.)It does have a few reflective moments of stillness, which are incredibly welcome - mostly concerning Dex and family (if the book was arguably slanted more towards Emma's side of the story, here it favours Dex) - but they're all too rare.The Bad:All too rare, because this one zips along like it's left the iron on (no mean feat in an 108 minute movie), galloping toward the denouement so that any emotional investment we might have made in it is almost completely wiped out. 1997, for example, literally lasts a swimming pool length. I know book-to-film adaptations bowdlerise to an extent, but this is absolutely ridiculous. There's also an argument to be made about the wisdom of letting writers adapt their own screenplays. Perhaps some sense of objectivity is lost in the process. Oddly enough, a previous David Nicholls' TV mini-series called 'I Saw You', starring Fay Ripley, is practically a warm-up for One Day, and is absolutely wonderful - very worth tracking down. That was in three parts. If the makers of One Day hadn't been so concerned with making a quick buck (usual story), this would have benefited from a mini-series of its own. But then, of course, there's no money in Telly.At its worst, the film's truncation manifests in a reliance on phone calls between the pair, which makes it seem as if Sturgess is frankly *stalking* Anne Hathaway. *That* twist, at least, is intact, and somewhat shocking. But in the same way a sudden glimpse of a mink being flayed alive in the middle of a Disney cartoon might be.Couldn't they have found one single British actress for crying out loud? Yes, I know only too well about the need for overseas investment. But you're not looking at Anne Hathaway thinking, 'working-class Northener' you're distractedly thinking, 'Isn't that... Anne Hathaway, working in a Tex Mex restaurant in Camden?'Romola Garai, who plays Sophie, would have done better - dressed-down a bit. (Or as often suggested, Carey Mulligan.) And how do they pull off Hathaway being only subtly attractive? Oversize specs. Because, you know, specs always make people look *dowdy*, apparently. I'm not even going to talk about her accent. You've heard it. It ranges from Angela's Ashes to... well, to Hathaway's own American accent, in fact.The Ugly:The more I think about this, the crosser I get. Film Emma never has any tawdry affairs, as in the novel, as it wouldn't suit her martyred character - and it wouldn't suit the fragrant Hathaway. A layered, interesting character becomes a 2-dimensional pouter; pure and nun-like. Just waiting around for Dexter to be ready, waiting for him to finally come around, and save her tormented soul. It's repulsive, actually - and *totally* a betrayal of her character and the spirit of the original. In short, it's not the very worst film in the world - it's just completely and utterly unremarkable; Sub-Richard Curtis, which is something this lovely and moving book just isn't.","10","19 August 2011"
"sdebord3136","I was pleasantly surprised by this film. I thought this was going to be another chick flick with a guy flirting with a girl but I found it was an amazing love story that spans 2 decades and gives a glimpse of what true love could really be. Anne H. was great for this because she is a timeless beauty that played her role through the years wonderfully, and Jim S. did a great job evolving with his character through immaturity to understanding. The European setting was beautiful and added to the scenes from the city to country side building the romance of it all.I wish I would have seen it sooner :)","7","20 November 2011"
"axxmy_one","People keep saying that movie adaptations from novels are usually not the same. Some are bad, some are okay, but in this case, it was beautiful. Lots of credit goes to David Nicholls for his excellent screenplay. Everything was PERFECT. Timeline, storyline and even the small details was well written. The acting was impeccable too. What about Anne Hathaway's accent? No problems there. Jim Sturgess plays the character Dexter perfectly. Most people would say that The Notebook is the top romantic teary eyed film. I tell them this: One Day is way better. It shows that two people can have friendship, loyalty, affection and love continuously. Watch it. Whether you have read the book or not, you will fall in love with Dexter & Emma !","10","24 November 2011"
"juneebuggy","I was a huge fan of the book by David Nicholls and really looked foreword to seeing this... And while it didn't quite live up to my expectations and somewhat failed to capture the love and tragedy of the novel it was still a decent enough romance.The lovely Jim Sturgess plays rich playboy Dexter, with the (mostly irritating) Anne Hathaway as working class woman Em. We join them in 1988 on the night of their college graduation where they almost get together, decide to be friends and then proceed to follow them over the course of the next two decades.We see them through assorted relationships, phone calls, fights, hopes, vacations, missed opportunities, laughter and tears. There is always the anticipation of, will these two ever get together? The tone of the movie is different than the book, trying to be a bit like 'When Harry Met Sally' and failing. I also didn't ever feel the connection between Dexter and Em. I guess I should stop comparing the two, apples and oranges and all that but when you adore a book as much as I did its hard.The ageing of the characters is very well done here, subtle but especially apparent at the very end when the movie flips back to the night they met and you go wow, look how young they were. The clothing is also true to the decade and there are some fun (bad) hairstyles. 1/4/15","9","1 April 2015"
"neil-476","I give advance notice that I am going to be spoilering fairly extensively as this review goes on: you have been warned. Spoiler-free synopsis: Emma and Dexter meet on the day they graduate from university (July 15th 1988): there is an instant connection, and they nearly do the deed, but not quite. Instead, they enter into a long-term friendship which we, the audience, look in on every year on the anniversary of their meeting. Without giving anything away at this point, Emma becomes a waitress and would-be author who takes up with an unsuccessful stand-up comedian, and Dexter becomes a promiscuous TV presenter. We can see that that, ideally, they should be together because Emma desperately loves Dexter, and would be able to turn him from the louche, dissolute rake he has become into the decent man he has the potential to be. But, as the years go by, they always shy away from it. Anne Hathaway plays Emma and Jim Sturgess plays Dexter.Let me comment on a couple of points frequently mentioned elsewhere. One, I had no problem with Anne Hathaway's accent. It was, mostly, a tolerable all purpose moderately well-spoken British accent, with occasional ""oop north"" flattened vowels unnecessarily thrown in. It didn't distract me. Two, I understand that the book is a big hit with a chunk of the audience (the cinema audience was mostly older women in pairs, some with husbands dragged along. I was the only solo male). I haven't read the book, so I have no comment as to how well the film represented it.This film irritated me. I recognise that I am not part of the target demographic for a romantic drama, but I can be reached: my tear glands are perfectly prepared to well up in appropriate circumstances. However, I left the cinema dry-eyed and stony-faced: this film did not touch me in the slightest.I think I was irritated with it right from the start. A young man, subsequently shown to be highly promiscuous, ends up in bed with a girl who is ready and willing, and then - nothing happens? No, I don't think so. From then onwards I was constantly aware of the attempted pushing of emotional manipulation buttons, and it just didn't work. I thought the acting was fine, the period atmosphere good despite the odd anachronism, but I couldn't see why these two totally dissimilar people were soulmates, nor why they kept in touch, what she saw in him - in short, nothing about the emotional side of the film worked for me at all.OK, now I'm going to get really spoilery. And then, after donkeys' years go by, and things go pear shaped for him, Dexter finally learns a bit of humility by which time Emma has found herself a French jazz pianist. She instantly dumps the poor pianist and takes up with Dexter. While trying for a baby of their own (he already has a daughter by a previous relationship), she - really, I'm warning you, stop reading now if you don't want to hit a B.I.G. spoiler - is killed in a traffic accident. We then enter the final section of the film which attempts to have its cake and eat it. Intercut with each other we see Dexter coming to terms with life after Emma's death, in touching (but all not that touching!) conversations with his daughter and Emma's old stand-up comedian boyfriend, plus we see a kind of re-set button version of the day Dexter and Emma first got together which leads us towards the more satisfying relationship they could have had/did have (?) For all these years.And that irritated me even more.I was never uninterested in what went on, but I should have been moved by this film, and I wasn't - and I think it is because it was full of emotional dishonesty from start to finish.","9","26 August 2011"
"jmc4769","I just got back home from seeing this movie, and I feel like I've been hit upside the head with a baseball bat. I'm a sucker for romantic movies, and I've sat through hundreds of mediocre ones that were watchable anyway. But One Day had to be one of the worst romance movies I have ever had the misfortune to endure. It was especially disappointing because I've loved Anne Hathaway in just about everything she's been in (Princess Diaries, Ella Enchanted, Rachel Getting Married, The Devil Wears Prada, Rio, etc.). One Day has few redeeming qualities, except for the occasional pretty scenery. The most serious problem is Jim Sturgess's character, Dexter. Dexter is an unlikable, shallow womanizer. I know what you're thinking: Charming womanizers are a staple of these movies. But Sturgess gives Dexter no charm, no glimmer of humanity, no hint that there may be lovable qualities beneath his contemptible persona. The usually wonderful Hathaway (Emma) gets mired down here in a bad script. And there is not the tiniest spark of chemistry between the two. I kept thinking, ""Come on, Emma, block this loser's number and take out a restraining order."" When the inevitable romance comes, it hasn't a shred of believability. This movie ultimately amounts to a plain Jane wish-fulfillment fantasy (yep, Hathaway is supposed to be plain)...sort of like those movies where the nerdy guy gets the hot girl. The plot structure is a big problem too. We see the main characters only on one day (July 15th) of every year from 1988 to 2011. Instead of continuity, character development, and relationship development, we get mostly uninteresting snippets of their lives. The final straw for me though was the surprise ending, which was a completely gratuitous attempt to insert meaningful drama into an otherwise vacuous movie. At this point, I was begging for the movie to be over, but no such luck. Incredibly, screenwriter (and author of the book of the same name), David Nicholls, drags this bad movie out for another 15 minutes or so.","4","19 August 2011"

"achyutaghosh","Disclaimer first up- biased review, as I am a sucker for love stories.I used to think that Hollywood had stopped making emotionally involving love stories. Thank god they made One Day, then. Based on the best selling book by British author Dave Nicholls, the movie explores the intertwined lives of two protagonists of contrasting nature, yet fated to be together. The premise is novel, with the relationship explored though a peek into 15th July of each year, spread over 22 years. Good stories are brought to life by good acting, and here we have two superb exponents in lead roles- Jim Sturgess as Dexter and Anna Hathaway as Emma. Dexter leads the high profile life, a television anchor with success in all forms chasing him, always. But then his life is also hollow, his friends shallow, and in the end, a faces disillusionment and compromise. Emma dwells in obscurity mostly, but through sheer tenacity and belief achieves a modicum of success as a writer. They meet when they are 18, decide to remain lifelong friends, and they do remain so. In the meanwhile meandering through the vagaries of life, they are inexorably drawn towards each other, dependent on each other.Childhood sweethearts, even if long lost, when they do come together, they do get together without any questions asked- i say this having witnessed the same on a close friend of mine. And you cant help but fall in love with Emma and Dexter- their love story is so compelling and adorable, that you become a part of their story, you care for them, you laugh with them, and also cry, you want them to do what you would do, and yes, you desperately want a happy ending for them.And of course there is Anna Hathaway-suitably rumpled and grunge in the first half, and elegance and grace personified in the second, when she flashes her pearly whites, the world seems to be a better place to live.Why do people in love get to be in love in the best of locations? One Day happens in picturesque Edinburgh, colourful London, and stylish Paris. And the best thing that makes it stand out among all love stories is that it is not predictable, till the very end. People and things change with time, but memories remain the same.- here's a movie that raises a toast to happy memories, a Must watch for mushy folks!","9","23 November 2011"
"Philby-3","One Day Two eighties graduates in Edinburgh have an encounter on graduation day, July 15th ; the film follows their relationship by annual updates. Dexter (Jim Sturgess) brilliant, charismatic and a total narcissist and Emma (Ann Hathaway), a demure, warm sort are not a great match and both hitch up with others, but their friendship endures.The film is romantic, but only to a point, and can hardly be described as a comedy; there is too much pain for that, despite some funny dialogue. It is a kind of growing older movie – early promise turning sour, bright young ambitious things tasting failure and settling for something less. The story is cleverly told and nicely shot, with good support from Ken Stott and Patricia Clarkson as Dexter's disapproving parents and Rhys Spall as Emma's husband. Jim Sturgess looks and acts uncannily like a younger Rupert Graves, who has portrayed a long line of charming handsome wastrels. Ann Hathaway might be from New York but she plays Emma perfectly – the dialect coaches really earned their money. Both of the principals manage to evoke our sympathy, though Sturgess has the harder job.July 15 is St Swithin's day. On that day in 1415 the English Army led by Henry V (alias Laurence Olivier or Kenneth Branagh) defeated a larger French force at Agincourt. This has absolutely nothing to do with the movie though Dexter and Emma do at one stage venture to Brittany, where they manage to lose their clothes in one of the film's more comedic moments.I couldn't help feeling the story arc was rather predictable but I was absorbed nonetheless. At the end I'm not sure what the attraction was for Emma – she was smart enough to realise Dexter was a jerk but somehow she couldn't resist. He does get better – perhaps deep down she wanted to reform him. Or perhaps deep down she wanted to be a bit wild too. A film for generation Xers who are wondering what the hell happened to their youthful dreams and plans.","7","14 September 2011"
"napierslogs","""One Day"", based on the novel of the same name, is the relationship of two people, Emma (Anne Hathaway) and Dexter (Jim Sturgess), as we see it on July 15th of each year. As can be expected from the nature of the story, it's a little dry, lacking in comedy. But then again, it's a romantic drama, not a romantic comedy.As is the nature of the two media, movies can never be exactly the same as the novel. But the problem with this one is that they tried to; no story lines were removed. Almost everything was there, just shortened into mostly meaningless segments. I personally could have done with one less event in their lives, and perhaps a different ending, but they tried to be as faithful as possible.What we have here is a movie about a relationship, but the novel was about the people. They traded in character depth and development so we can see them in their more attractive years falling in and out of love.I wasn't very familiar with Jim Sturgess, having seen him play skinny, slightly nerdy, not as confident kids. Dexter is a different breed of guy. Just has high on self-confidence as he is on drugs and alcohol, he gets by on his looks – literally – he's a TV host. Although the different characteristics of Dexter weren't explicitly shown in the movie, Sturgess brought them out in him perfectly. Emma is a more complex character, with significant evolution to who she is throughout the years, except none of that is in the movie, so it just wasn't really possible for Hathaway to portray her as a more interesting person.I would assume that watching ""One Day"" without the benefit of having read the novel would be a fairly confusing, empty experience. With the background that the novel gave me, I could fill in all the missing years and the unexplored layers to the characters, so there was still something to their relationship for me.","8","19 August 2011"
"TheBobbyjames","Very seldom in Hollywood are movies produced that are as emotionally involving as 'One Day.' It's a beautiful, beautiful love story of two people, Emma (Anne Hathaway) and Dex (Jim Sturgess). After spending the night together after graduation, we are taken on a journey into their lives for one day each year after they met; to see where they are or where they're not. Based on the book by David Nicholls (who also wrote the screenplay), 'One Day' transitions from novel to film brilliantly.First let me say film acting is what I believe makes or breaks a movie - if the actors are great, the movie is generally great. That's not to take away from any other element of film at all, but when everything else is done so well, if the acting were bad, the film would have been less memorable. But Anne Hathaway and Jim Sturgess are so very impressive here. They make their characters real and relatable, which are two key things every actor internally wishes they could do. In fact, as an on-screen pair, they work extremely well, together they exude chemistry.What I found most interesting about the entire experience was that I cared so much. I became enamoured with their lives. I kept hoping for the best. I anticipated what would happen to each of them. I sat forward, sat backward. I laughed and I cried. I've said many times before, a great movie will effect you emotionally in more ways than one. You'll be angry, you'll be happy, you'll be sad - the key is that you emote. This movie presented all of those elements. It was fresh and witty and everything you hope a movie will be. It's as beautifully made as it is acted and the locations are exquisite. Far too often, characters in Hollywood seem contrived and are not genuine. 'One Day' is honestly one of the most genuine stories ever told - there is no instant gratification, there is however frustration and that is the beauty of it all. It explores love and love lost, it explores friendship and the constraints of time and distance. It explores each character's journey to happiness and the trials they face along the way. So many little pieces of the puzzle are filled in between the years by simple, single lines of dialogue or actions. It's not the typical script of ""everything's all good-obstacle-everything ends well"" - there's a lot more complexity which makes it realistically genuine.So many little details, like eye-lines, smiles, sighs, cut-off conversations, etc. were paid attention to. The costuming, cinematography and score were spot on and all noteworthy. All of it combined was moving and awe-inspiring. I left the theater crying, but it didn't stop there, even thinking about the movie and those characters is deeply affecting. Maybe there are some underlying themes in the film that I'm identifying with, or maybe, just maybe the actors were really that great. Whatever it is, this film comes with my highest recommendation, is rated PG-13 and runs 107 minutes.","7","31 August 2011"
"TheLittleSongbird","The book was a wonderful read. One Day was a movie I was looking forward to, and while it was disappointing I found it very pleasant.What made the book so good and such a joy to read was not just the emotional impact, modern angst and characterisation but also how nostalgic it made me. The emotional impact and angst is here in the movie, what wasn't quite there was the nostalgia-evidence of it but could've been more- and characterisation which does feel choppy especially with Patricia Clarkson's Alison though Dexter is well realised.That said, I loved the beautiful look of the film, the soundtrack which gave the film its sense of nostalgia and the witty banter between Sturgess and Hathaway. The romantic elements are touching though the comedic elements don't always work coming across as a tad contrived. The direction is decent, the telling of the story is well paced(if somewhat glacial) and faithful and the script has some nice touches but also some weak ones. Of the support performances I thought Rafe Spall, Romola Garai and Ken Stott were the most effective and Clarkson was good if deserving of more to do. The picture belongs to Jim Sturgess, while staying true to his bad boy character of Dexter he also manages to be sympathetic.My feelings on Anne Hathaway were mixed. I loved her radiance and her chemistry with Sturgess, but her accent was inconsistent and felt forced and unnatural whenever she tried it. The shock ending also felt more bewildering than anything else, not the actual tragedy itself but rather the flashbacks that succeeded that I wasn't sure was really needed.In conclusion, pleasant if not entirely successful. 6.5/10 Bethany Cox","4","31 August 2011"
"JimmyCollins","Words cannot describe how wonderful an actress Anne Hathaway is, and in One Day she is in fine form, if there ever was an actress to go down in the history books among the greats it would be her. Jim Sturgess is quite a charming devil swell.The story that takes place in One Day is at moments the anti love story and other times a sweeping epic romance, even though this movie has been adapted from a book it's still a lot more original than other romantic themed films of late. Lone Scherfig definitely suits this style of English romance, starting with An Education and now this, it may sound mean but I just don't think the romantic dramas that come from the U.S have the same genuine feel that the English films do.I had read the book and i have to say that this is a very loyal adaptation, much of the beauty from the book is clear and present here, particularly the friendship aspect between Dex and Emma, in the book it's a quirky kind of friendship and it transferred well on the screen as, I was very pleased that the film makers didn't ruin that with a cheap silly sexual type of friendship.I could say a lot about how lovely this movie is but I think I'll let everyone make up their own mind. A lot of people have a bad opinion of this movie which I find baffling but I suppose each to their own, I just got totally wrapped up in this gorgeous romance.10 out of 10","3","3 September 2011"
"queen_of_naboo88","I went to see One Day last night, and though I had been looking forward to it for a while, I was surprised at how good it actually is. The film has a very unique atmosphere, as it is much quirkier than your average romance. Also, without giving away the ending, I can say that it isn't as predictable as one might think. What I really liked about it was the complexity of the different human relationships that we are shown. The relationship between Emma and Dexter is by no means an easy one, nor is it one-sided. Given how different they are, there is a lot of conflict between them, although they do love each other. Similarly, what Dexter and his ex-wife feel for one another is never pure hatred, but there is a lot of understanding between them. As a consequence, the story seems like it could be taken from real life. Plus, both Hathaway and Sturgess are as convincing as always, which makes this film absolutely worth seeing.","3","19 August 2011"
"guest_pabby","After perusing other reviews for this movie, I believe that many of the ratings are low, not because viewers disliked the movie, but because they disliked the element in which the film shines. The film succeeds in drawing the audience into the friendship between the main characters, played by Jim Sturgess and Anne Hathaway. Both characters find happiness and meaning in parts of their lives, while suffering through other portions without attaining goals they've set for themselves; i.e., this is real life.What the poorly-rating reviewers seek is escapism. In my view--however limited--this film aims to depict two human beings as they learn, grow, and fall in and out of touch with one another. Thus, don't expect any fairy tales here and don't punish the rating on this movie because it isn't a fairy tale! A predictable conclusion to this movie would place Sturgess and Hathaway side by side, married, and living together untouched by the trials of a realistic relationship. Instead, the director effectively and with calculation showcases some of life in the scenes and merely hints at events not shown on the screen. As the film narrates exclusively through one date each year (hence, the name), partial narratives are expected. The final third of the film, shunned by a few reviewers, elevated the creative vision of the story because it introduces the unpredictable nature of real life into a movie that was otherwise a run-of-the-mill romance. Again, speaking in terms of the development between characters, the movie is above average. Speaking in terms of storyline, the first two-thirds, to a certain degree, lack what the final third delivers: surprise! The juxtaposition of the present with the past near the end of this film makes the events even more potent than they would have been. Audience members who do not fall into the ""half-wit"" category can follow the story, regardless of what the viewers who read the novel state in their reviews. Bravo! Lastly, Anne Hathaway is exceedingly lovely.","8","3 September 2011"
"ferguson-6","Greetings again from the darkness. I have not read David Nicholls' novel, but my understanding is that it is extremely well written and its loyal readers really connected with Emma and Dexter. If that's true, then this film version is even worse than I thought while watching.This literally is my least favorite type of movie. A movie that assumes its viewers are unable to think for themselves or judge the actions of its characters. In other words, the filmmakers take for granted that we will accept whatever is shown on the big screen.First let me say that I completely understand the school girl crush that a young Emma (Anne Hathaway) has on her classmate Dexter (Jim Sturgess). He is handsome and charismatic and comes from more money than she. I also understand Dexter's attraction to the lovely Emma. She is very pretty - despite the ridiculous over-sized glasses for the early scenes - and very intelligent, and a significantly nicer person than he.What makes absolutely no sense to me is her continued attraction to this drunken, empty soul for the next twenty years. She is too smart to pine away the years hoping he will wise up and coming running to her. We are supposed to believe that she has no interest in any other relationship other than the non-threatening one with flopping stand-up comedian Ian (played by Timothy Spall's son Rafe) and a ""boring"" French Jazz Pianist.Dexter's mother is played by Patricia Clarkson. As she is dying from cancer, she tells him that she believes he will grow into a good man, but isn't there yet. I guess we are supposed to take her word for it. Instead we only see Dexter go from a selfish pig as a TV personality to a defeated man who must perform manual labor for the first time in his life. My issue is that a defeated man is not necessarily a good man. A man resigned to his life has not necessarily reached enlightenment. Where is Emma's proof that he deserves her? Where is the indication that her life with him will be better? I tell you where ... in the mind of that school girl from years ago.Please don't mistake my words as that of one who has no faith in romantic stories. There are so many ways this story could have turned that it would have had me. Instead it chose a path that assumed I was ignorant ... totally accepting of ridiculous story being laid out for me.My final comments on the film involve the cast. Anne Hathaway is an incredibly talented performer. She is not, however, British. Her accent is terribly distracting. Jim Sturgess is a handsome guy, but just not charismatic enough to pull off the TV personality role. Patricia Clarkson is a fantastic actress, but she is not British either. Seriously, are there not enough British actresses? The casting smells like a money-grubbing production team. As for director Lone Scherfig ... her previous film An Education was cinematic excellence. This is an unacceptable follow-up and we expect better next time.I will say the locations of Edinburg, London and Paris were beautiful and different than we usually get from the movies. That provided the only real enjoyment from this highly disappointing movie.","10","21 August 2011"
"Rob-O-Cop","this had some great aspects to it but ultimately failed to deliver. Firstly the good. Brilliant locations, beautiful cinematography, Anne Hathaway delivers a good performance,The bad. The editor and the director failed to establish a believable connection between the two lead actors as to why they would form a lasting bond that would carry them over 20 years. We're given a hint of this at the end but that doesn't help or fix the rest of the movie, so that's the bad editing aspect of this. if this scene had been at the front it might have helped sell the movie. That that scene didn't really deliver the goods needed to make it believable is the directors mistake along with many of the other scenes that tips the scale against the characters. Too many scenes of Dexter being a jerk and not enough of him being in anyway lovable or charming, even though there was much amusement to be had in the jerk Dexter scenes they blew out the balance of his character and it wasn't till the end that we got to see him as anything less than a jerk, but by then it was too late and it didn't really do anything to alter the confusion of why Emma would have cared. I also didn't buy Jim Sturgess performance, although a lot of people think differently, he came across as a caricature rather than a character. People have criticised Anne Hathaway's accent and there's probably some weight to that but I personally didn't find it annoying once I thought what's going on with her accent as it fluctuated all over the show. That's a continuity and a direction flaw as much as it is her performance. After a few mins I put it in the multi-sourced accent file as many people have blended accents. Outside of that Anne's delivering some really good depth in her work so much so that we may one day forgive her for the princess diaries.","9","27 January 2012"
"francine-k","I had watched ""One Day"" yesterday and was beyond excited because I had read the novel by David Nicholls, which was fantastic. The movie base's around 2 people and their twenty years together, shown only through one day, July 15th. I thought the plot was unique and was a very realistic romance. Sometimes it takes people a lot to lose to realize what life is about, and how certain people are truly important to you. The movie was cute, funny, and quite sad at times. I thought Anne Hathaway did an okay job on the accent, to me it was odd at first but after a couple minutes I had gotten used to it. Her acting was great and you can really see her changing as the years progress. Jim Sturgess was great and in my opinion really portrayed Dexter the best as possible, with the arrogance and attitude exactly as I imagined Dexter would have. In my own opinion the movie was a great watch, was a romance that I had been dying for ever sense The Notebook. Finally a tear jerking but smile at the end movie, that really anyone can enjoy, if your looking for a romance movie.","8","20 August 2011"
"JohnDeSando","One Day is promoted as drama romance and not a rom com. On all three counts I would call it out anyway, for it is a melodramatic, episodic tale of two best friends in London, Emma (Anne Hathaway) and Dexter (Jim Sturgess), who flirt with love over a long period but play on the standard cliché that requires they eventually end up together, regardless how many marriages and children intervene.One Day has too many short episodes from college in the '80's until professional life in 2011, and each seems just a variation on another before it: boy gets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl back again, well, you know the routine. During all these little skirmishes Emma remains wholesome (no stretch for the perpetually cute Hathaway, reminding me of Sally Hawkins' Poppy in Mike Leigh's Happy Go Lucky. But without Hawkins' charisma).Dexter is a cad and Lothario almost all the way, making him unlikeable and difficult to gain our sympathy. His cavalier treatment of his mother (the ever-interesting Patricia Clarkson) and father (Ken Stott) adds to his surly persona. In addition, Sturgess needs a little coaching or better script if he wishes to catch up with the Ryans (Gosling and Reynolds) in the emerging leading-man lineup.Nowhere do I feel a real sexual heat, especially since in most of the film they are avowing to be just friends. Moreover in the numerous years/episodes I do not feel the intellectual and emotional connection that comes so naturally in Richard Linklater's Before Sunrise/Sunset series. Even director Lone Scherfig's Parisian scenes are vacant, poor cousins to Woody Allen's romantic City of Lights in Midnight in Paris.As an Anglophile, I usually can forgive many sins if a film gives me an adequate dose of the great city, but as with the Paris background, romance takes a holiday even from the cities.","1","23 August 2011"
"blanbrn","Over the summer I saw this film sure it's typical chick flick, still as a male I admire the beauty and sexy look of Anne Hathaway who I think is a brilliant actress. Plus I think she pulled the international accent off just fine in this film and as always her look is sharp and just fine. This is a love story that spans time with memories these moments touch you staying with you forever despite when an unexpected tragedy strikes.Set in England it involves a couple Em(Anne Hathaway) and Dexter(Jim Sturgess) and after this international couple graduates from college and meet and fall for one another on July 15, 1989. From every year on on this date it's considered an anniversary for this couple as the film shows the special moments that happened during the lives of both. As each year on the same day is highlighted you see that no matter what path their lives have taken love and memories draw them together.Overall this is a film of memory and everlasting love sadly an unexpected tragedy occurs, but still with memories Dexter will love Em forever as long as memories are around love can last forever. Probably not a great film but worth a watch for any Anne Hathaway fan.","9","10 October 2011"
"jeffallenhammer","Does life imitate art or does art imitate life? I'm one who tends to avoid the discussion entirely by saying ""both."" One Day is the most real (save a few accents) movie I've seen in a long time. It explores time and how it often slips away from us. Our hearts' desires are often decimated by bad timing, and the movie finds a variety of ways to demonstrate this. So in the case of One Day, art imitates life to the fullest, as we can all sympathize (if only a little) to crushed hopes and shattered dreams, though hopefully we eventually find our way.Anne Hathaway stars as insecure working-class woman Emma, who, for one reason or another is drawn to Dexter, (Jim Sturgess) a charming upper middle class man with a great amount of self-confidence. It may be hard to understand just what the two have on each other, but they are characters I'm familiar with. The woman who is way too into a man that's way too into himself, it happens and for the type, Dex is pretty likable. Em and Dex have nothing in common. But their opposite personalities do what a relationship should; make each other better. They are Yin and Yang, complementary opposites.An interesting technique used by One Day, is that we only get to see the events of a single day, July 15, for each of 20 plus years. Some of my peers have taken to calling this a gimmick. In a year where it seems every other film is either a sequel or a remake/reboot, (which critics and public alike have grown tired of) I feel fresh ideas should be applauded, even if it doesn't quite work. For me, however, it worked to perfection. Director Lone Scherfig (An Education) paints the picture of Em and Dex's up and down relationship with great finesse, never having too much happen on the date year to year. The filmmaker fills us in on what has taken place throughout each year, without conversations seeming inorganic. The cinematography is beautiful, especially a scene where our would-be lovers break all their rules by taking a dip at sunset. There's plenty of humor, joy, sadness, regret and a number of other emotions to be felt. I caution viewers that this isn't a romantic comedy, nor does it end like one. One Day is, however, easily one of the most heartfelt films of the year and should be celebrated for its bravery.","8","31 August 2011"
"fernandoschiavi","Based on David Nichols' bestseller, ""One Day"" is a more mature Nicholas Sparks version, but equally tearful and melodramatic. Based on a peculiar and intriguing narrative structure, which revisits the 15th of July in the lives of Dexter and Emma since 1988 over more than 20 years, the story focuses on the maturation of the relationship between its characters, fleeing the punctuality and immediacy that surrounds most novels. Ironically, this same artifice reveals the main weakness of the script - others will be seen in the following paragraphs - because the annual reunion with the characters does not hide the considerable loss of information that motivated sudden changes in the life and behavior of each one.Sensitively directed by the Danish Lone Scherfig (""Education""), who delicately builds the fluid dynamic between Dexter and Emma (Hathaway), One Day is skillful in establishing the passage of time also with the aid of an impeccable make-up job - and notice how Sturgess, in particular, goes from a smooth-faced, jovial boy to a weary middle-aged man with wrinkles and bags under his eyes, while Hathaway emerges chubby (but not exaggeratedly so) after working two years as a waitress in a Mexican restaurant, which is an interesting detail. Benefiting from a competent cast that creates equally complex secondary characters that help compose the journey of the main couple (worth mentioning Rafe Spall, son of Timothy, who transforms the aspiring comedian Ian into a man that is simultaneously pathetic and moving), the film fails here and there by investing in stereotyped characterizations, but still avoiding that they dominate the narrative - and if Dexter's father appears as the typical ""cold and critical father"", Ken Stott manages to make him softer through occasional hesitations that point out his internal effort to try to get closer to the child.Likewise, if Nicholls' dialogues are occasionally forced to appeal to exposition in order to clarify what happened to the characters in the previous year, this is balanced by the good construction of so many other lines (especially those spoken by Hathaway), which they display the cold irony typical of British humor (Emma at one point describes the restaurant where she works as a ""graveyard of ambitions""). As if that were not enough, the script also creates really sensitive interactions between those people, highlighting the brief and beautiful scene between Dexter and his mother, who, played by Patricia Clarkson, shows melancholy and love when telling her son that, even certain that he will be a good man, realizes that he ""isn't there yet"".The dialogues are a strong point of the script, also written by David Nicholls. They are fast, with intelligent insights and manage to perfectly translate the personality of each character and their relationships with each other. Even with silly jokes, like Dexter's mother in Paris saying to her son, ""look over there, Alain Delon"" ... or not, it's your father"", demonstrating how much she is in love with her husband. There are funny scenes too, like when Dexter plays the most famous scene of Spartacus with the dolls for his daughter. But no character is better translated by the dialogues than Emma, the shy girl, but extremely intelligent and sagacious. Each of her lines is a bit of her temperament, feeling, spontaneity.However, it is even in the construction of Dexter and Emma that ""One Day"" proves to be particularly efficient: while the boy quickly achieves professional success, the girl struggles for years trying to make her artistic aspirations viable - a situation that gradually reverses as that we perceive that the former lacks the intellectual, emotional and psychological content that sustains his career, while Emma, growing from suffering, reflection and the simple experience of life, gradually transforms herself into a mature woman and ready to overcome the obstacles that previously prevented it from moving forward (and Sturgess and Hathaway, talented and charismatic, confidently illustrate these changes).The problem is that Hathaway's character quickly becomes the link with the audience. The dreamy sweetness, the sweetness and the detachment transform Emma into a very pleasant company, something that Dexter cannot see. Unsympathetic, self-centered and narcissistic, he uses Emma more as someone to quench the loneliness caused by her personality and assuage her pain and addictions than as a true friendship. Played by the expressionless Sturgess and his characteristic face of suffering, it is practically impossible to believe the beautiful and sensitive Emma fell in love with the guy after a disastrous dinner in which he exposes her (dis)interest. In this way, she emerges as the tragic anchor of the narrative, surrendering herself to the loves of a person she does not love, just to fill the sentimental need. What is revealed in the most cliché of sentences, enunciated according to the Nicholas Sparks booklet: ""she made him decent; you made her happy"".As Emma and Dexter mature, the adolescent, dreamy and inconsequential traits give way to realistic, cynical and disillusioned versions, propelled by tragedies, some of them approached with excessive disregard and disengagement due to the narrative structure - yet another negative effect of this. Elevated to the status of protagonist, an incorrect and questionable decision, Dexter undergoes a wide dramatic arc from his mother's illness (Clarkson), the cancellation of the television program, his marriage to Sylvie (Romola Garai, the young woman from ""Desire and Reparation"" and increasingly better actress), to an event that would definitely humanize him. At times, Emma's life is described in terms of her dream of becoming a writer or her relationship with Ian (Rafe Spall), which is disappointing.By scrutinizing and dissecting fractions of those characters' lives, certain moments should be more appropriately explored in David Nicholls' script. Dexter's firing after a botched interview and being hired on a video game show lacks a glimpse into the character's journey, though we understand what led to this precipitous fall. Similarly, Emma's relationship with Ian, presented at a dinner party without sparks or the guy's inability to make jokes, culminates in the explanation that she can't ""take him watching Wrath of Khan every day anymore"". This excessive exposition becomes constant in the film, requiring that a character needs to contextualize the events that are taking place to the public, which exposes the artificiality of the undertaking; well, if Emma and Dexter are such good friends, it was expected that he would reveal the bad news in the expected time and not months later.On the other hand, the annual narrative is well explored by Danish director Lone Scherfig, and the use of raccords and ellipses in Barney Pilling's montage stands out. And not just temporality, but the duo of characters allows Benoît Delhomme's photography to individualize Emma's trajectory in a nostalgic sepia, while Dexter is bathed in a depressing bluish color palette. Finally, Rachel Portman's score avoids being too intrusive, competently punctuating the narrative. Yes, the idea is curious and the narrative exercise valid (albeit flawed). The trajectory of two people is drawn before our eyes and, let's face it, it's not something usual in novel production. It is a pity, therefore, that the chosen 15th of July sounds hopelessly clichéd and expositional, making the unknown 364 remaining days of each year seem more interesting by comparison.We cannot, however, say that the film is not romantic. It has its moments, even if it prepares us to tears in such an obvious and brief way. Soon we will be in the next year, and the year after that, forgetting the pain and moving on. But that doesn't stop us from living in the moment. They are brief, it is true, but true and well-constructed. Especially in the final act, where we desperately want to go back to the beginning, as an attempt to remake the story, or at least fool our minds with that simple encounter in the middle of the street and a kiss seals the love story that should have been. Director Lone Scherfig managed to bring delicacy to the story of Emma and Dexter, making ""One Day"" a sensitive film. A love story built without resources common to films of this nature. Everything is almost realistic and fearful as life. She regrets that, when the situation picks up, she pulls the rug out from under us, with a cliché situation, announced, made just to make us cry. And she didn't even make it. Still, a good movie of its kind.","6","12 May 2023"
"Likes_Ninjas90","In the late 80s a girl named Emma (Anne Hathaway) is a college student who meets fellow graduate Dexter (Jim Sturgess). They're about to sleep together one evening but decide to remain friends instead. Over the course of twenty years we see how circumstances and other people have kept them divided when they just want to be together. Dexter finds himself hosting a ghastly television show, while being warned by his sick mother (Patricia Clarkson) that he isn't a particularly nice person anymore. He insists that he just wants to have fun, despite being critically panned and moving between women. Emma works her way up from a job in a fast food restaurant, to a teacher and then eventually into a successful author. To the distress of Dexter she has a serious relationship with an obnoxious comedian, which puts her real desires on hold. Late in the timeline, Dexter is married rather unhappily and has a baby girl to look after. An unlikeable leading man makes this one day too many. It's impossible to say what type of movie One Day is. It postures as a comedy but it barely raises a single laugh. And though it also lacks dramatic impact for much of its length too, its one climax is so shocking and over the top that it will leave a sour taste in your mouth. Do not consider this as a date movie. You will not be popular. You also have to wonder late in the movie what the point was. Director Lone Scherfig (An Education, 2009) tries to end things on a very syrupy note. That's very nice for one of the characters but unrewarding for the audience who have waded through twenty years in the lives of these unappealing characters for nothing. The message is ultimately a very obvious, unoriginal and simple one: that life pulls people in opposite directions but happiness can be found in one single moment. Using an extended chronological structure is a gimmick. It allows for little on screen titles to appear in the frame, just like in (500) Days of Summer (2009) but it refuses to enrich character. A film like Blue Valentine (2010) is infinitively more intelligent because it realises that character is structure. It contrasts the past and present day to visualise the changing personalities of its leads and the impact on their relationship. The script by David Nicholls, adapting his own novel, lacks this kind of sophistication. Having the film move through such an extensive period suggests that there will be arching transformations in the characters. But unfortunately Sturgess remains continuously unlikeable all throughout this movie. His character is arrogant, rude, promiscuous and irresponsible. And briefly touching on his fractured relationship with his parents does not make him anymore sympathetic. Patricia Clarkson is barely in this movie because she has so few scenes and I wasn't moved by her appearances as the film intended. One of the golden rules of the romantic comedy is broken here: you don't understand why Emma and Dexter belong together. This is a detriment to the film's plotting and the motives of the characters. We're left wondering what this apparently sophisticated woman continues to see in this buffoon, especially when she's already with better company. Even after that huge climax Dexter still has a moment of madness. Only at the very end does he wake up to himself. The actors aren't really to blame. Anne Hathaway is such a pleasant actress in almost everything she does, comedy or otherwise. But this sketchy, underwritten role wastes her talents and doesn't stretch her chops at all. She's made to look dorky and uptight with her over-sized glasses, only to move into little but quirkiness. And Jim Sturgess who I liked in Across the Universe (2007) and The Way Back (2010) is gifted too, with no shortage of personality. He just happens to be playing a real jerk. If that's what he intended, he certainly succeeded. As far as the rebirth of frank romantic-comedies goes this is a pretty uninspired and limp entry.","10","24 August 2011"
"ianlouisiana","Here in the UK we call people like this ""Up themselves""and I can't think of a film where that description of the characters is more applicable.
One frankly poisonous bloke with his brains in his pants tries for 20 - odd years to seduce a girl he was at university with.
That,basically,is what ""One Day"" is all about.
It's not a love story for heaven sake,he is pathologically incapable of feeling so complex an emotion.
Except towards himself.
She wastes a significant proportion of her life waiting for him to change into a completely different person then,quite inexplicably decides she'll take him on as he is.Maybe she is hearing her biological clock.ticking.
Whatever,she dumps her French jazz pianist boyfriend so quickly he hardly has time to learn the melodic minor scale.
The device on which ""One Day"" hangs is so flimsy I lost interest very early on.
It might have been more winning if the writer had made the ""One Day"" the 29th February - at least it would have been over sooner.
All you need to know about the characters is that they play the terribly posh game ""Are you there,Moriarty"",an Oxbridge version of Blind Man's Buff with added violence .
Under the guise of which the seriously unpleasant guy smacks his girlfriend very hard in the face with a rolled up newspaper,causing her nose to bleed.

"chaz-28","There is a lingering and persistent distraction throughout One Day which severely impairs the audience from becoming absorbed in the film. This is Anne Hathaway's atrocious accent. Many Americans have at varying degrees in the past successfully pulled off a believable British accent. However, Anne Hathaway's character, Emma Morley, sounds at different times Irish, Scottish, and American, but never British. It truly was irritating after awhile. Why didn't the filmmakers just cast a British actress? Or, if they were dead set on Hathaway playing Emma, then move the whole story to America. If not for the distracting aural miscues, this film would most likely be much more enjoyable.Emma and Dexter (Jim Sturgess) meet the night of college graduation at the tail end of an all night party. This is not a meet-cute either. They are the only two left as the last couple pairs off with each other; therefore, fate has thrown them together to have a one night stand. Things get in the way and they end up deciding to be friends and start a very long platonic relationship. This is mostly convincing as Emma is seen to be truly infatuated with Dexter who does not see her in the same light, in fact, he treats her rather poorly as the years go by. Graduation night was July 15th by the way so naturally the pair concocts a plan to meet up annually on that day or at least check in my telephone if this is not possible.Surprisingly, every July 15th is actually a pretty horrible, sad day for each of them. Very rarely is one or both of them in a good mood and happy with where their life is at when the film jumps forward to another July 15th. Furthermore, the film focuses much more on Dexter than Emma with extensive scenes concerning his alcoholism and career missteps. Emma even authors a successful book and it hardly gets a mention until Dexter happens upon it. This made me wonder that if Dexter was to have so much more attention and screen time than Emma, why all the fuss to make Anne Hathaway British? Since the screenplay was written by the same gentlemen who wrote the novel this film is based on, the story's climax is inevitable even though it is forced and manipulative. The scene is also very poorly shot. The director, Lone Scherfig, who made the brilliant An Education two years ago, completely misses the mark with this scene and the rest of the film suffers for it. The event is set up in a way that even people who venture out and see one movie a year will be able to see what is coming up.Another miscue is Patricia Clarkson's role as Dexter's mother. It feels her role has been severely cut during the editing process. Not only does she have dialogue in the preview which is not in the movie, but she only shows up in about two-three scenes, moves the plot along, and then she's out of there. I have not read the novel, but I guarantee she is a much larger presence on those pages than what seems to be a faint echo of her in this movie.P.S. There is an atrocious Elvis Costello song over the closing credits which destroys any lingering fondness or afterthoughts the audience may have been enjoying during the closing scenes.","10","24 August 2011"
"Ali_John_Catterall","Yes, entirely predictably (well, you probably guessed as much from the trailer), they made an utter pig's ear of it. The Good:As Dex, Jim Sturgess is decent - nails the look, and the accent (both of them). Rafe Spall, as hapless wannabe comedian Ian is also fine - although there isn't a scintilla of genuine anguish about him when he's dumped, but hey, it's not his story right? (To be honest, it's a wonder they didn't simply represent him with a balloon on a stick.)It does have a few reflective moments of stillness, which are incredibly welcome - mostly concerning Dex and family (if the book was arguably slanted more towards Emma's side of the story, here it favours Dex) - but they're all too rare.The Bad:All too rare, because this one zips along like it's left the iron on (no mean feat in an 108 minute movie), galloping toward the denouement so that any emotional investment we might have made in it is almost completely wiped out. 1997, for example, literally lasts a swimming pool length. I know book-to-film adaptations bowdlerise to an extent, but this is absolutely ridiculous. There's also an argument to be made about the wisdom of letting writers adapt their own screenplays. Perhaps some sense of objectivity is lost in the process. Oddly enough, a previous David Nicholls' TV mini-series called 'I Saw You', starring Fay Ripley, is practically a warm-up for One Day, and is absolutely wonderful - very worth tracking down. That was in three parts. If the makers of One Day hadn't been so concerned with making a quick buck (usual story), this would have benefited from a mini-series of its own. But then, of course, there's no money in Telly.At its worst, the film's truncation manifests in a reliance on phone calls between the pair, which makes it seem as if Sturgess is frankly *stalking* Anne Hathaway. *That* twist, at least, is intact, and somewhat shocking. But in the same way a sudden glimpse of a mink being flayed alive in the middle of a Disney cartoon might be.Couldn't they have found one single British actress for crying out loud? Yes, I know only too well about the need for overseas investment. But you're not looking at Anne Hathaway thinking, 'working-class Northener' you're distractedly thinking, 'Isn't that... Anne Hathaway, working in a Tex Mex restaurant in Camden?'Romola Garai, who plays Sophie, would have done better - dressed-down a bit. (Or as often suggested, Carey Mulligan.) And how do they pull off Hathaway being only subtly attractive? Oversize specs. Because, you know, specs always make people look *dowdy*, apparently. I'm not even going to talk about her accent. You've heard it. It ranges from Angela's Ashes to... well, to Hathaway's own American accent, in fact.The Ugly:The more I think about this, the crosser I get. Film Emma never has any tawdry affairs, as in the novel, as it wouldn't suit her martyred character - and it wouldn't suit the fragrant Hathaway. A layered, interesting character becomes a 2-dimensional pouter; pure and nun-like. Just waiting around for Dexter to be ready, waiting for him to finally come around, and save her tormented soul. It's repulsive, actually - and *totally* a betrayal of her character and the spirit of the original. In short, it's not the very worst film in the world - it's just completely and utterly unremarkable; Sub-Richard Curtis, which is something this lovely and moving book just isn't.","9","19 August 2011"
"sdebord3136","I was pleasantly surprised by this film. I thought this was going to be another chick flick with a guy flirting with a girl but I found it was an amazing love story that spans 2 decades and gives a glimpse of what true love could really be. Anne H. was great for this because she is a timeless beauty that played her role through the years wonderfully, and Jim S. did a great job evolving with his character through immaturity to understanding. The European setting was beautiful and added to the scenes from the city to country side building the romance of it all.I wish I would have seen it sooner :)","9","20 November 2011"
"axxmy_one","People keep saying that movie adaptations from novels are usually not the same. Some are bad, some are okay, but in this case, it was beautiful. Lots of credit goes to David Nicholls for his excellent screenplay. Everything was PERFECT. Timeline, storyline and even the small details was well written. The acting was impeccable too. What about Anne Hathaway's accent? No problems there. Jim Sturgess plays the character Dexter perfectly. Most people would say that The Notebook is the top romantic teary eyed film. I tell them this: One Day is way better. It shows that two people can have friendship, loyalty, affection and love continuously. Watch it. Whether you have read the book or not, you will fall in love with Dexter & Emma !","4","24 November 2011"
"juneebuggy","I was a huge fan of the book by David Nicholls and really looked foreword to seeing this... And while it didn't quite live up to my expectations and somewhat failed to capture the love and tragedy of the novel it was still a decent enough romance.The lovely Jim Sturgess plays rich playboy Dexter, with the (mostly irritating) Anne Hathaway as working class woman Em. We join them in 1988 on the night of their college graduation where they almost get together, decide to be friends and then proceed to follow them over the course of the next two decades.We see them through assorted relationships, phone calls, fights, hopes, vacations, missed opportunities, laughter and tears. There is always the anticipation of, will these two ever get together? The tone of the movie is different than the book, trying to be a bit like 'When Harry Met Sally' and failing. I also didn't ever feel the connection between Dexter and Em. I guess I should stop comparing the two, apples and oranges and all that but when you adore a book as much as I did its hard.The ageing of the characters is very well done here, subtle but especially apparent at the very end when the movie flips back to the night they met and you go wow, look how young they were. The clothing is also true to the decade and there are some fun (bad) hairstyles. 1/4/15","5","1 April 2015"
"neil-476","I give advance notice that I am going to be spoilering fairly extensively as this review goes on: you have been warned. Spoiler-free synopsis: Emma and Dexter meet on the day they graduate from university (July 15th 1988): there is an instant connection, and they nearly do the deed, but not quite. Instead, they enter into a long-term friendship which we, the audience, look in on every year on the anniversary of their meeting. Without giving anything away at this point, Emma becomes a waitress and would-be author who takes up with an unsuccessful stand-up comedian, and Dexter becomes a promiscuous TV presenter. We can see that that, ideally, they should be together because Emma desperately loves Dexter, and would be able to turn him from the louche, dissolute rake he has become into the decent man he has the potential to be. But, as the years go by, they always shy away from it. Anne Hathaway plays Emma and Jim Sturgess plays Dexter.Let me comment on a couple of points frequently mentioned elsewhere. One, I had no problem with Anne Hathaway's accent. It was, mostly, a tolerable all purpose moderately well-spoken British accent, with occasional ""oop north"" flattened vowels unnecessarily thrown in. It didn't distract me. Two, I understand that the book is a big hit with a chunk of the audience (the cinema audience was mostly older women in pairs, some with husbands dragged along. I was the only solo male). I haven't read the book, so I have no comment as to how well the film represented it.This film irritated me. I recognise that I am not part of the target demographic for a romantic drama, but I can be reached: my tear glands are perfectly prepared to well up in appropriate circumstances. However, I left the cinema dry-eyed and stony-faced: this film did not touch me in the slightest.I think I was irritated with it right from the start. A young man, subsequently shown to be highly promiscuous, ends up in bed with a girl who is ready and willing, and then - nothing happens? No, I don't think so. From then onwards I was constantly aware of the attempted pushing of emotional manipulation buttons, and it just didn't work. I thought the acting was fine, the period atmosphere good despite the odd anachronism, but I couldn't see why these two totally dissimilar people were soulmates, nor why they kept in touch, what she saw in him - in short, nothing about the emotional side of the film worked for me at all.OK, now I'm going to get really spoilery. And then, after donkeys' years go by, and things go pear shaped for him, Dexter finally learns a bit of humility by which time Emma has found herself a French jazz pianist. She instantly dumps the poor pianist and takes up with Dexter. While trying for a baby of their own (he already has a daughter by a previous relationship), she - really, I'm warning you, stop reading now if you don't want to hit a B.I.G. spoiler - is killed in a traffic accident. We then enter the final section of the film which attempts to have its cake and eat it. Intercut with each other we see Dexter coming to terms with life after Emma's death, in touching (but all not that touching!) conversations with his daughter and Emma's old stand-up comedian boyfriend, plus we see a kind of re-set button version of the day Dexter and Emma first got together which leads us towards the more satisfying relationship they could have had/did have (?) For all these years.And that irritated me even more.I was never uninterested in what went on, but I should have been moved by this film, and I wasn't - and I think it is because it was full of emotional dishonesty from start to finish.","9","26 August 2011"
"jmc4769","I just got back home from seeing this movie, and I feel like I've been hit upside the head with a baseball bat. I'm a sucker for romantic movies, and I've sat through hundreds of mediocre ones that were watchable anyway. But One Day had to be one of the worst romance movies I have ever had the misfortune to endure. It was especially disappointing because I've loved Anne Hathaway in just about everything she's been in (Princess Diaries, Ella Enchanted, Rachel Getting Married, The Devil Wears Prada, Rio, etc.). One Day has few redeeming qualities, except for the occasional pretty scenery. The most serious problem is Jim Sturgess's character, Dexter. Dexter is an unlikable, shallow womanizer. I know what you're thinking: Charming womanizers are a staple of these movies. But Sturgess gives Dexter no charm, no glimmer of humanity, no hint that there may be lovable qualities beneath his contemptible persona. The usually wonderful Hathaway (Emma) gets mired down here in a bad script. And there is not the tiniest spark of chemistry between the two. I kept thinking, ""Come on, Emma, block this loser's number and take out a restraining order."" When the inevitable romance comes, it hasn't a shred of believability. This movie ultimately amounts to a plain Jane wish-fulfillment fantasy (yep, Hathaway is supposed to be plain)...sort of like those movies where the nerdy guy gets the hot girl. The plot structure is a big problem too. We see the main characters only on one day (July 15th) of every year from 1988 to 2011. Instead of continuity, character development, and relationship development, we get mostly uninteresting snippets of their lives. The final straw for me though was the surprise ending, which was a completely gratuitous attempt to insert meaningful drama into an otherwise vacuous movie. At this point, I was begging for the movie to be over, but no such luck. Incredibly, screenwriter (and author of the book of the same name), David Nicholls, drags this bad movie out for another 15 minutes or so.","7","19 August 2011"

She's just so ... beautiful in every meaning of this word. Can't wait to see her next summer in ""TDKR"".

"achyutaghosh","Disclaimer first up- biased review, as I am a sucker for love stories.I used to think that Hollywood had stopped making emotionally involving love stories. Thank god they made One Day, then. Based on the best selling book by British author Dave Nicholls, the movie explores the intertwined lives of two protagonists of contrasting nature, yet fated to be together. The premise is novel, with the relationship explored though a peek into 15th July of each year, spread over 22 years. Good stories are brought to life by good acting, and here we have two superb exponents in lead roles- Jim Sturgess as Dexter and Anna Hathaway as Emma. Dexter leads the high profile life, a television anchor with success in all forms chasing him, always. But then his life is also hollow, his friends shallow, and in the end, a faces disillusionment and compromise. Emma dwells in obscurity mostly, but through sheer tenacity and belief achieves a modicum of success as a writer. They meet when they are 18, decide to remain lifelong friends, and they do remain so. In the meanwhile meandering through the vagaries of life, they are inexorably drawn towards each other, dependent on each other.Childhood sweethearts, even if long lost, when they do come together, they do get together without any questions asked- i say this having witnessed the same on a close friend of mine. And you cant help but fall in love with Emma and Dexter- their love story is so compelling and adorable, that you become a part of their story, you care for them, you laugh with them, and also cry, you want them to do what you would do, and yes, you desperately want a happy ending for them.And of course there is Anna Hathaway-suitably rumpled and grunge in the first half, and elegance and grace personified in the second, when she flashes her pearly whites, the world seems to be a better place to live.Why do people in love get to be in love in the best of locations? One Day happens in picturesque Edinburgh, colourful London, and stylish Paris. And the best thing that makes it stand out among all love stories is that it is not predictable, till the very end. People and things change with time, but memories remain the same.- here's a movie that raises a toast to happy memories, a Must watch for mushy folks!","7","23 November 2011"
"Philby-3","One Day Two eighties graduates in Edinburgh have an encounter on graduation day, July 15th ; the film follows their relationship by annual updates. Dexter (Jim Sturgess) brilliant, charismatic and a total narcissist and Emma (Ann Hathaway), a demure, warm sort are not a great match and both hitch up with others, but their friendship endures.The film is romantic, but only to a point, and can hardly be described as a comedy; there is too much pain for that, despite some funny dialogue. It is a kind of growing older movie – early promise turning sour, bright young ambitious things tasting failure and settling for something less. The story is cleverly told and nicely shot, with good support from Ken Stott and Patricia Clarkson as Dexter's disapproving parents and Rhys Spall as Emma's husband. Jim Sturgess looks and acts uncannily like a younger Rupert Graves, who has portrayed a long line of charming handsome wastrels. Ann Hathaway might be from New York but she plays Emma perfectly – the dialect coaches really earned their money. Both of the principals manage to evoke our sympathy, though Sturgess has the harder job.July 15 is St Swithin's day. On that day in 1415 the English Army led by Henry V (alias Laurence Olivier or Kenneth Branagh) defeated a larger French force at Agincourt. This has absolutely nothing to do with the movie though Dexter and Emma do at one stage venture to Brittany, where they manage to lose their clothes in one of the film's more comedic moments.I couldn't help feeling the story arc was rather predictable but I was absorbed nonetheless. At the end I'm not sure what the attraction was for Emma – she was smart enough to realise Dexter was a jerk but somehow she couldn't resist. He does get better – perhaps deep down she wanted to reform him. Or perhaps deep down she wanted to be a bit wild too. A film for generation Xers who are wondering what the hell happened to their youthful dreams and plans.","4","14 September 2011"
"napierslogs","""One Day"", based on the novel of the same name, is the relationship of two people, Emma (Anne Hathaway) and Dexter (Jim Sturgess), as we see it on July 15th of each year. As can be expected from the nature of the story, it's a little dry, lacking in comedy. But then again, it's a romantic drama, not a romantic comedy.As is the nature of the two media, movies can never be exactly the same as the novel. But the problem with this one is that they tried to; no story lines were removed. Almost everything was there, just shortened into mostly meaningless segments. I personally could have done with one less event in their lives, and perhaps a different ending, but they tried to be as faithful as possible.What we have here is a movie about a relationship, but the novel was about the people. They traded in character depth and development so we can see them in their more attractive years falling in and out of love.I wasn't very familiar with Jim Sturgess, having seen him play skinny, slightly nerdy, not as confident kids. Dexter is a different breed of guy. Just has high on self-confidence as he is on drugs and alcohol, he gets by on his looks – literally – he's a TV host. Although the different characteristics of Dexter weren't explicitly shown in the movie, Sturgess brought them out in him perfectly. Emma is a more complex character, with significant evolution to who she is throughout the years, except none of that is in the movie, so it just wasn't really possible for Hathaway to portray her as a more interesting person.I would assume that watching ""One Day"" without the benefit of having read the novel would be a fairly confusing, empty experience. With the background that the novel gave me, I could fill in all the missing years and the unexplored layers to the characters, so there was still something to their relationship for me.","3","19 August 2011"
"TheBobbyjames","Very seldom in Hollywood are movies produced that are as emotionally involving as 'One Day.' It's a beautiful, beautiful love story of two people, Emma (Anne Hathaway) and Dex (Jim Sturgess). After spending the night together after graduation, we are taken on a journey into their lives for one day each year after they met; to see where they are or where they're not. Based on the book by David Nicholls (who also wrote the screenplay), 'One Day' transitions from novel to film brilliantly.First let me say film acting is what I believe makes or breaks a movie - if the actors are great, the movie is generally great. That's not to take away from any other element of film at all, but when everything else is done so well, if the acting were bad, the film would have been less memorable. But Anne Hathaway and Jim Sturgess are so very impressive here. They make their characters real and relatable, which are two key things every actor internally wishes they could do. In fact, as an on-screen pair, they work extremely well, together they exude chemistry.What I found most interesting about the entire experience was that I cared so much. I became enamoured with their lives. I kept hoping for the best. I anticipated what would happen to each of them. I sat forward, sat backward. I laughed and I cried. I've said many times before, a great movie will effect you emotionally in more ways than one. You'll be angry, you'll be happy, you'll be sad - the key is that you emote. This movie presented all of those elements. It was fresh and witty and everything you hope a movie will be. It's as beautifully made as it is acted and the locations are exquisite. Far too often, characters in Hollywood seem contrived and are not genuine. 'One Day' is honestly one of the most genuine stories ever told - there is no instant gratification, there is however frustration and that is the beauty of it all. It explores love and love lost, it explores friendship and the constraints of time and distance. It explores each character's journey to happiness and the trials they face along the way. So many little pieces of the puzzle are filled in between the years by simple, single lines of dialogue or actions. It's not the typical script of ""everything's all good-obstacle-everything ends well"" - there's a lot more complexity which makes it realistically genuine.So many little details, like eye-lines, smiles, sighs, cut-off conversations, etc. were paid attention to. The costuming, cinematography and score were spot on and all noteworthy. All of it combined was moving and awe-inspiring. I left the theater crying, but it didn't stop there, even thinking about the movie and those characters is deeply affecting. Maybe there are some underlying themes in the film that I'm identifying with, or maybe, just maybe the actors were really that great. Whatever it is, this film comes with my highest recommendation, is rated PG-13 and runs 107 minutes.","3","31 August 2011"
"TheLittleSongbird","The book was a wonderful read. One Day was a movie I was looking forward to, and while it was disappointing I found it very pleasant.What made the book so good and such a joy to read was not just the emotional impact, modern angst and characterisation but also how nostalgic it made me. The emotional impact and angst is here in the movie, what wasn't quite there was the nostalgia-evidence of it but could've been more- and characterisation which does feel choppy especially with Patricia Clarkson's Alison though Dexter is well realised.That said, I loved the beautiful look of the film, the soundtrack which gave the film its sense of nostalgia and the witty banter between Sturgess and Hathaway. The romantic elements are touching though the comedic elements don't always work coming across as a tad contrived. The direction is decent, the telling of the story is well paced(if somewhat glacial) and faithful and the script has some nice touches but also some weak ones. Of the support performances I thought Rafe Spall, Romola Garai and Ken Stott were the most effective and Clarkson was good if deserving of more to do. The picture belongs to Jim Sturgess, while staying true to his bad boy character of Dexter he also manages to be sympathetic.My feelings on Anne Hathaway were mixed. I loved her radiance and her chemistry with Sturgess, but her accent was inconsistent and felt forced and unnatural whenever she tried it. The shock ending also felt more bewildering than anything else, not the actual tragedy itself but rather the flashbacks that succeeded that I wasn't sure was really needed.In conclusion, pleasant if not entirely successful. 6.5/10 Bethany Cox","8","31 August 2011"
"JimmyCollins","Words cannot describe how wonderful an actress Anne Hathaway is, and in One Day she is in fine form, if there ever was an actress to go down in the history books among the greats it would be her. Jim Sturgess is quite a charming devil swell.The story that takes place in One Day is at moments the anti love story and other times a sweeping epic romance, even though this movie has been adapted from a book it's still a lot more original than other romantic themed films of late. Lone Scherfig definitely suits this style of English romance, starting with An Education and now this, it may sound mean but I just don't think the romantic dramas that come from the U.S have the same genuine feel that the English films do.I had read the book and i have to say that this is a very loyal adaptation, much of the beauty from the book is clear and present here, particularly the friendship aspect between Dex and Emma, in the book it's a quirky kind of friendship and it transferred well on the screen as, I was very pleased that the film makers didn't ruin that with a cheap silly sexual type of friendship.I could say a lot about how lovely this movie is but I think I'll let everyone make up their own mind. A lot of people have a bad opinion of this movie which I find baffling but I suppose each to their own, I just got totally wrapped up in this gorgeous romance.10 out of 10","10","3 September 2011"
"queen_of_naboo88","I went to see One Day last night, and though I had been looking forward to it for a while, I was surprised at how good it actually is. The film has a very unique atmosphere, as it is much quirkier than your average romance. Also, without giving away the ending, I can say that it isn't as predictable as one might think. What I really liked about it was the complexity of the different human relationships that we are shown. The relationship between Emma and Dexter is by no means an easy one, nor is it one-sided. Given how different they are, there is a lot of conflict between them, although they do love each other. Similarly, what Dexter and his ex-wife feel for one another is never pure hatred, but there is a lot of understanding between them. As a consequence, the story seems like it could be taken from real life. Plus, both Hathaway and Sturgess are as convincing as always, which makes this film absolutely worth seeing.","9","19 August 2011"
"guest_pabby","After perusing other reviews for this movie, I believe that many of the ratings are low, not because viewers disliked the movie, but because they disliked the element in which the film shines. The film succeeds in drawing the audience into the friendship between the main characters, played by Jim Sturgess and Anne Hathaway. Both characters find happiness and meaning in parts of their lives, while suffering through other portions without attaining goals they've set for themselves; i.e., this is real life.What the poorly-rating reviewers seek is escapism. In my view--however limited--this film aims to depict two human beings as they learn, grow, and fall in and out of touch with one another. Thus, don't expect any fairy tales here and don't punish the rating on this movie because it isn't a fairy tale! A predictable conclusion to this movie would place Sturgess and Hathaway side by side, married, and living together untouched by the trials of a realistic relationship. Instead, the director effectively and with calculation showcases some of life in the scenes and merely hints at events not shown on the screen. As the film narrates exclusively through one date each year (hence, the name), partial narratives are expected. The final third of the film, shunned by a few reviewers, elevated the creative vision of the story because it introduces the unpredictable nature of real life into a movie that was otherwise a run-of-the-mill romance. Again, speaking in terms of the development between characters, the movie is above average. Speaking in terms of storyline, the first two-thirds, to a certain degree, lack what the final third delivers: surprise! The juxtaposition of the present with the past near the end of this film makes the events even more potent than they would have been. Audience members who do not fall into the ""half-wit"" category can follow the story, regardless of what the viewers who read the novel state in their reviews. Bravo! Lastly, Anne Hathaway is exceedingly lovely.","8","3 September 2011"
"ferguson-6","Greetings again from the darkness. I have not read David Nicholls' novel, but my understanding is that it is extremely well written and its loyal readers really connected with Emma and Dexter. If that's true, then this film version is even worse than I thought while watching.This literally is my least favorite type of movie. A movie that assumes its viewers are unable to think for themselves or judge the actions of its characters. In other words, the filmmakers take for granted that we will accept whatever is shown on the big screen.First let me say that I completely understand the school girl crush that a young Emma (Anne Hathaway) has on her classmate Dexter (Jim Sturgess). He is handsome and charismatic and comes from more money than she. I also understand Dexter's attraction to the lovely Emma. She is very pretty - despite the ridiculous over-sized glasses for the early scenes - and very intelligent, and a significantly nicer person than he.What makes absolutely no sense to me is her continued attraction to this drunken, empty soul for the next twenty years. She is too smart to pine away the years hoping he will wise up and coming running to her. We are supposed to believe that she has no interest in any other relationship other than the non-threatening one with flopping stand-up comedian Ian (played by Timothy Spall's son Rafe) and a ""boring"" French Jazz Pianist.Dexter's mother is played by Patricia Clarkson. As she is dying from cancer, she tells him that she believes he will grow into a good man, but isn't there yet. I guess we are supposed to take her word for it. Instead we only see Dexter go from a selfish pig as a TV personality to a defeated man who must perform manual labor for the first time in his life. My issue is that a defeated man is not necessarily a good man. A man resigned to his life has not necessarily reached enlightenment. Where is Emma's proof that he deserves her? Where is the indication that her life with him will be better? I tell you where ... in the mind of that school girl from years ago.Please don't mistake my words as that of one who has no faith in romantic stories. There are so many ways this story could have turned that it would have had me. Instead it chose a path that assumed I was ignorant ... totally accepting of ridiculous story being laid out for me.My final comments on the film involve the cast. Anne Hathaway is an incredibly talented performer. She is not, however, British. Her accent is terribly distracting. Jim Sturgess is a handsome guy, but just not charismatic enough to pull off the TV personality role. Patricia Clarkson is a fantastic actress, but she is not British either. Seriously, are there not enough British actresses? The casting smells like a money-grubbing production team. As for director Lone Scherfig ... her previous film An Education was cinematic excellence. This is an unacceptable follow-up and we expect better next time.I will say the locations of Edinburg, London and Paris were beautiful and different than we usually get from the movies. That provided the only real enjoyment from this highly disappointing movie.","1","21 August 2011"
"Rob-O-Cop","this had some great aspects to it but ultimately failed to deliver. Firstly the good. Brilliant locations, beautiful cinematography, Anne Hathaway delivers a good performance,The bad. The editor and the director failed to establish a believable connection between the two lead actors as to why they would form a lasting bond that would carry them over 20 years. We're given a hint of this at the end but that doesn't help or fix the rest of the movie, so that's the bad editing aspect of this. if this scene had been at the front it might have helped sell the movie. That that scene didn't really deliver the goods needed to make it believable is the directors mistake along with many of the other scenes that tips the scale against the characters. Too many scenes of Dexter being a jerk and not enough of him being in anyway lovable or charming, even though there was much amusement to be had in the jerk Dexter scenes they blew out the balance of his character and it wasn't till the end that we got to see him as anything less than a jerk, but by then it was too late and it didn't really do anything to alter the confusion of why Emma would have cared. I also didn't buy Jim Sturgess performance, although a lot of people think differently, he came across as a caricature rather than a character. People have criticised Anne Hathaway's accent and there's probably some weight to that but I personally didn't find it annoying once I thought what's going on with her accent as it fluctuated all over the show. That's a continuity and a direction flaw as much as it is her performance. After a few mins I put it in the multi-sourced accent file as many people have blended accents. Outside of that Anne's delivering some really good depth in her work so much so that we may one day forgive her for the princess diaries.","9","27 January 2012"
"francine-k","I had watched ""One Day"" yesterday and was beyond excited because I had read the novel by David Nicholls, which was fantastic. The movie base's around 2 people and their twenty years together, shown only through one day, July 15th. I thought the plot was unique and was a very realistic romance. Sometimes it takes people a lot to lose to realize what life is about, and how certain people are truly important to you. The movie was cute, funny, and quite sad at times. I thought Anne Hathaway did an okay job on the accent, to me it was odd at first but after a couple minutes I had gotten used to it. Her acting was great and you can really see her changing as the years progress. Jim Sturgess was great and in my opinion really portrayed Dexter the best as possible, with the arrogance and attitude exactly as I imagined Dexter would have. In my own opinion the movie was a great watch, was a romance that I had been dying for ever sense The Notebook. Finally a tear jerking but smile at the end movie, that really anyone can enjoy, if your looking for a romance movie.","8","20 August 2011"
"JohnDeSando","One Day is promoted as drama romance and not a rom com. On all three counts I would call it out anyway, for it is a melodramatic, episodic tale of two best friends in London, Emma (Anne Hathaway) and Dexter (Jim Sturgess), who flirt with love over a long period but play on the standard cliché that requires they eventually end up together, regardless how many marriages and children intervene.One Day has too many short episodes from college in the '80's until professional life in 2011, and each seems just a variation on another before it: boy gets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl back again, well, you know the routine. During all these little skirmishes Emma remains wholesome (no stretch for the perpetually cute Hathaway, reminding me of Sally Hawkins' Poppy in Mike Leigh's Happy Go Lucky. But without Hawkins' charisma).Dexter is a cad and Lothario almost all the way, making him unlikeable and difficult to gain our sympathy. His cavalier treatment of his mother (the ever-interesting Patricia Clarkson) and father (Ken Stott) adds to his surly persona. In addition, Sturgess needs a little coaching or better script if he wishes to catch up with the Ryans (Gosling and Reynolds) in the emerging leading-man lineup.Nowhere do I feel a real sexual heat, especially since in most of the film they are avowing to be just friends. Moreover in the numerous years/episodes I do not feel the intellectual and emotional connection that comes so naturally in Richard Linklater's Before Sunrise/Sunset series. Even director Lone Scherfig's Parisian scenes are vacant, poor cousins to Woody Allen's romantic City of Lights in Midnight in Paris.As an Anglophile, I usually can forgive many sins if a film gives me an adequate dose of the great city, but as with the Paris background, romance takes a holiday even from the cities.","6","23 August 2011"
"blanbrn","Over the summer I saw this film sure it's typical chick flick, still as a male I admire the beauty and sexy look of Anne Hathaway who I think is a brilliant actress. Plus I think she pulled the international accent off just fine in this film and as always her look is sharp and just fine. This is a love story that spans time with memories these moments touch you staying with you forever despite when an unexpected tragedy strikes.Set in England it involves a couple Em(Anne Hathaway) and Dexter(Jim Sturgess) and after this international couple graduates from college and meet and fall for one another on July 15, 1989. From every year on on this date it's considered an anniversary for this couple as the film shows the special moments that happened during the lives of both. As each year on the same day is highlighted you see that no matter what path their lives have taken love and memories draw them together.Overall this is a film of memory and everlasting love sadly an unexpected tragedy occurs, but still with memories Dexter will love Em forever as long as memories are around love can last forever. Probably not a great film but worth a watch for any Anne Hathaway fan.","10","10 October 2011"
"jeffallenhammer","Does life imitate art or does art imitate life? I'm one who tends to avoid the discussion entirely by saying ""both."" One Day is the most real (save a few accents) movie I've seen in a long time. It explores time and how it often slips away from us. Our hearts' desires are often decimated by bad timing, and the movie finds a variety of ways to demonstrate this. So in the case of One Day, art imitates life to the fullest, as we can all sympathize (if only a little) to crushed hopes and shattered dreams, though hopefully we eventually find our way.Anne Hathaway stars as insecure working-class woman Emma, who, for one reason or another is drawn to Dexter, (Jim Sturgess) a charming upper middle class man with a great amount of self-confidence. It may be hard to understand just what the two have on each other, but they are characters I'm familiar with. The woman who is way too into a man that's way too into himself, it happens and for the type, Dex is pretty likable. Em and Dex have nothing in common. But their opposite personalities do what a relationship should; make each other better. They are Yin and Yang, complementary opposites.An interesting technique used by One Day, is that we only get to see the events of a single day, July 15, for each of 20 plus years. Some of my peers have taken to calling this a gimmick. In a year where it seems every other film is either a sequel or a remake/reboot, (which critics and public alike have grown tired of) I feel fresh ideas should be applauded, even if it doesn't quite work. For me, however, it worked to perfection. Director Lone Scherfig (An Education) paints the picture of Em and Dex's up and down relationship with great finesse, never having too much happen on the date year to year. The filmmaker fills us in on what has taken place throughout each year, without conversations seeming inorganic. The cinematography is beautiful, especially a scene where our would-be lovers break all their rules by taking a dip at sunset. There's plenty of humor, joy, sadness, regret and a number of other emotions to be felt. I caution viewers that this isn't a romantic comedy, nor does it end like one. One Day is, however, easily one of the most heartfelt films of the year and should be celebrated for its bravery.","7","31 August 2011"
"fernandoschiavi","Based on David Nichols' bestseller, ""One Day"" is a more mature Nicholas Sparks version, but equally tearful and melodramatic. Based on a peculiar and intriguing narrative structure, which revisits the 15th of July in the lives of Dexter and Emma since 1988 over more than 20 years, the story focuses on the maturation of the relationship between its characters, fleeing the punctuality and immediacy that surrounds most novels. Ironically, this same artifice reveals the main weakness of the script - others will be seen in the following paragraphs - because the annual reunion with the characters does not hide the considerable loss of information that motivated sudden changes in the life and behavior of each one.Sensitively directed by the Danish Lone Scherfig (""Education""), who delicately builds the fluid dynamic between Dexter and Emma (Hathaway), One Day is skillful in establishing the passage of time also with the aid of an impeccable make-up job - and notice how Sturgess, in particular, goes from a smooth-faced, jovial boy to a weary middle-aged man with wrinkles and bags under his eyes, while Hathaway emerges chubby (but not exaggeratedly so) after working two years as a waitress in a Mexican restaurant, which is an interesting detail. Benefiting from a competent cast that creates equally complex secondary characters that help compose the journey of the main couple (worth mentioning Rafe Spall, son of Timothy, who transforms the aspiring comedian Ian into a man that is simultaneously pathetic and moving), the film fails here and there by investing in stereotyped characterizations, but still avoiding that they dominate the narrative - and if Dexter's father appears as the typical ""cold and critical father"", Ken Stott manages to make him softer through occasional hesitations that point out his internal effort to try to get closer to the child.Likewise, if Nicholls' dialogues are occasionally forced to appeal to exposition in order to clarify what happened to the characters in the previous year, this is balanced by the good construction of so many other lines (especially those spoken by Hathaway), which they display the cold irony typical of British humor (Emma at one point describes the restaurant where she works as a ""graveyard of ambitions""). As if that were not enough, the script also creates really sensitive interactions between those people, highlighting the brief and beautiful scene between Dexter and his mother, who, played by Patricia Clarkson, shows melancholy and love when telling her son that, even certain that he will be a good man, realizes that he ""isn't there yet"".The dialogues are a strong point of the script, also written by David Nicholls. They are fast, with intelligent insights and manage to perfectly translate the personality of each character and their relationships with each other. Even with silly jokes, like Dexter's mother in Paris saying to her son, ""look over there, Alain Delon"" ... or not, it's your father"", demonstrating how much she is in love with her husband. There are funny scenes too, like when Dexter plays the most famous scene of Spartacus with the dolls for his daughter. But no character is better translated by the dialogues than Emma, the shy girl, but extremely intelligent and sagacious. Each of her lines is a bit of her temperament, feeling, spontaneity.However, it is even in the construction of Dexter and Emma that ""One Day"" proves to be particularly efficient: while the boy quickly achieves professional success, the girl struggles for years trying to make her artistic aspirations viable - a situation that gradually reverses as that we perceive that the former lacks the intellectual, emotional and psychological content that sustains his career, while Emma, growing from suffering, reflection and the simple experience of life, gradually transforms herself into a mature woman and ready to overcome the obstacles that previously prevented it from moving forward (and Sturgess and Hathaway, talented and charismatic, confidently illustrate these changes).The problem is that Hathaway's character quickly becomes the link with the audience. The dreamy sweetness, the sweetness and the detachment transform Emma into a very pleasant company, something that Dexter cannot see. Unsympathetic, self-centered and narcissistic, he uses Emma more as someone to quench the loneliness caused by her personality and assuage her pain and addictions than as a true friendship. Played by the expressionless Sturgess and his characteristic face of suffering, it is practically impossible to believe the beautiful and sensitive Emma fell in love with the guy after a disastrous dinner in which he exposes her (dis)interest. In this way, she emerges as the tragic anchor of the narrative, surrendering herself to the loves of a person she does not love, just to fill the sentimental need. What is revealed in the most cliché of sentences, enunciated according to the Nicholas Sparks booklet: ""she made him decent; you made her happy"".As Emma and Dexter mature, the adolescent, dreamy and inconsequential traits give way to realistic, cynical and disillusioned versions, propelled by tragedies, some of them approached with excessive disregard and disengagement due to the narrative structure - yet another negative effect of this. Elevated to the status of protagonist, an incorrect and questionable decision, Dexter undergoes a wide dramatic arc from his mother's illness (Clarkson), the cancellation of the television program, his marriage to Sylvie (Romola Garai, the young woman from ""Desire and Reparation"" and increasingly better actress), to an event that would definitely humanize him. At times, Emma's life is described in terms of her dream of becoming a writer or her relationship with Ian (Rafe Spall), which is disappointing.By scrutinizing and dissecting fractions of those characters' lives, certain moments should be more appropriately explored in David Nicholls' script. Dexter's firing after a botched interview and being hired on a video game show lacks a glimpse into the character's journey, though we understand what led to this precipitous fall. Similarly, Emma's relationship with Ian, presented at a dinner party without sparks or the guy's inability to make jokes, culminates in the explanation that she can't ""take him watching Wrath of Khan every day anymore"". This excessive exposition becomes constant in the film, requiring that a character needs to contextualize the events that are taking place to the public, which exposes the artificiality of the undertaking; well, if Emma and Dexter are such good friends, it was expected that he would reveal the bad news in the expected time and not months later.On the other hand, the annual narrative is well explored by Danish director Lone Scherfig, and the use of raccords and ellipses in Barney Pilling's montage stands out. And not just temporality, but the duo of characters allows Benoît Delhomme's photography to individualize Emma's trajectory in a nostalgic sepia, while Dexter is bathed in a depressing bluish color palette. Finally, Rachel Portman's score avoids being too intrusive, competently punctuating the narrative. Yes, the idea is curious and the narrative exercise valid (albeit flawed). The trajectory of two people is drawn before our eyes and, let's face it, it's not something usual in novel production. It is a pity, therefore, that the chosen 15th of July sounds hopelessly clichéd and expositional, making the unknown 364 remaining days of each year seem more interesting by comparison.We cannot, however, say that the film is not romantic. It has its moments, even if it prepares us to tears in such an obvious and brief way. Soon we will be in the next year, and the year after that, forgetting the pain and moving on. But that doesn't stop us from living in the moment. They are brief, it is true, but true and well-constructed. Especially in the final act, where we desperately want to go back to the beginning, as an attempt to remake the story, or at least fool our minds with that simple encounter in the middle of the street and a kiss seals the love story that should have been. Director Lone Scherfig managed to bring delicacy to the story of Emma and Dexter, making ""One Day"" a sensitive film. A love story built without resources common to films of this nature. Everything is almost realistic and fearful as life. She regrets that, when the situation picks up, she pulls the rug out from under us, with a cliché situation, announced, made just to make us cry. And she didn't even make it. Still, a good movie of its kind.","10","12 May 2023"
"Likes_Ninjas90","In the late 80s a girl named Emma (Anne Hathaway) is a college student who meets fellow graduate Dexter (Jim Sturgess). They're about to sleep together one evening but decide to remain friends instead. Over the course of twenty years we see how circumstances and other people have kept them divided when they just want to be together. Dexter finds himself hosting a ghastly television show, while being warned by his sick mother (Patricia Clarkson) that he isn't a particularly nice person anymore. He insists that he just wants to have fun, despite being critically panned and moving between women. Emma works her way up from a job in a fast food restaurant, to a teacher and then eventually into a successful author. To the distress of Dexter she has a serious relationship with an obnoxious comedian, which puts her real desires on hold. Late in the timeline, Dexter is married rather unhappily and has a baby girl to look after. An unlikeable leading man makes this one day too many. It's impossible to say what type of movie One Day is. It postures as a comedy but it barely raises a single laugh. And though it also lacks dramatic impact for much of its length too, its one climax is so shocking and over the top that it will leave a sour taste in your mouth. Do not consider this as a date movie. You will not be popular. You also have to wonder late in the movie what the point was. Director Lone Scherfig (An Education, 2009) tries to end things on a very syrupy note. That's very nice for one of the characters but unrewarding for the audience who have waded through twenty years in the lives of these unappealing characters for nothing. The message is ultimately a very obvious, unoriginal and simple one: that life pulls people in opposite directions but happiness can be found in one single moment. Using an extended chronological structure is a gimmick. It allows for little on screen titles to appear in the frame, just like in (500) Days of Summer (2009) but it refuses to enrich character. A film like Blue Valentine (2010) is infinitively more intelligent because it realises that character is structure. It contrasts the past and present day to visualise the changing personalities of its leads and the impact on their relationship. The script by David Nicholls, adapting his own novel, lacks this kind of sophistication. Having the film move through such an extensive period suggests that there will be arching transformations in the characters. But unfortunately Sturgess remains continuously unlikeable all throughout this movie. His character is arrogant, rude, promiscuous and irresponsible. And briefly touching on his fractured relationship with his parents does not make him anymore sympathetic. Patricia Clarkson is barely in this movie because she has so few scenes and I wasn't moved by her appearances as the film intended. One of the golden rules of the romantic comedy is broken here: you don't understand why Emma and Dexter belong together. This is a detriment to the film's plotting and the motives of the characters. We're left wondering what this apparently sophisticated woman continues to see in this buffoon, especially when she's already with better company. Even after that huge climax Dexter still has a moment of madness. Only at the very end does he wake up to himself. The actors aren't really to blame. Anne Hathaway is such a pleasant actress in almost everything she does, comedy or otherwise. But this sketchy, underwritten role wastes her talents and doesn't stretch her chops at all. She's made to look dorky and uptight with her over-sized glasses, only to move into little but quirkiness. And Jim Sturgess who I liked in Across the Universe (2007) and The Way Back (2010) is gifted too, with no shortage of personality. He just happens to be playing a real jerk. If that's what he intended, he certainly succeeded. As far as the rebirth of frank romantic-comedies goes this is a pretty uninspired and limp entry.","9","24 August 2011"
"ianlouisiana","Here in the UK we call people like this ""Up themselves""and I can't think of a film where that description of the characters is more applicable.
One frankly poisonous bloke with his brains in his pants tries for 20 - odd years to seduce a girl he was at university with.
That,basically,is what ""One Day"" is all about.
It's not a love story for heaven sake,he is pathologically incapable of feeling so complex an emotion.
Except towards himself.
She wastes a significant proportion of her life waiting for him to change into a completely different person then,quite inexplicably decides she'll take him on as he is.Maybe she is hearing her biological clock.ticking.
Whatever,she dumps her French jazz pianist boyfriend so quickly he hardly has time to learn the melodic minor scale.
The device on which ""One Day"" hangs is so flimsy I lost interest very early on.
It might have been more winning if the writer had made the ""One Day"" the 29th February - at least it would have been over sooner.
All you need to know about the characters is that they play the terribly posh game ""Are you there,Moriarty"",an Oxbridge version of Blind Man's Buff with added violence .
Under the guise of which the seriously unpleasant guy smacks his girlfriend very hard in the face with a rolled up newspaper,causing her nose to bleed.
She(the lovely Romelai Garai - by far the best performance)still marries him and has his baby.
Well,I never said they were clever.","9","25 February 2018"
"chaz-28","There is a lingering and persistent distraction throughout One Day which severely impairs the audience from becoming absorbed in the film. This is Anne Hathaway's atrocious accent. Many Americans have at varying degrees in the past successfully pulled off a believable British accent. However, Anne Hathaway's character, Emma Morley, sounds at different times Irish, Scottish, and American, but never British. It truly was irritating after awhile. Why didn't the filmmakers just cast a British actress? Or, if they were dead set on Hathaway playing Emma, then move the whole story to America. If not for the distracting aural miscues, this film would most likely be much more enjoyable.Emma and Dexter (Jim Sturgess) meet the night of college graduation at the tail end of an all night party. This is not a meet-cute either. They are the only two left as the last couple pairs off with each other; therefore, fate has thrown them together to have a one night stand. Things get in the way and they end up deciding to be friends and start a very long platonic relationship. This is mostly convincing as Emma is seen to be truly infatuated with Dexter who does not see her in the same light, in fact, he treats her rather poorly as the years go by. Graduation night was July 15th by the way so naturally the pair concocts a plan to meet up annually on that day or at least check in my telephone if this is not possible.Surprisingly, every July 15th is actually a pretty horrible, sad day for each of them. Very rarely is one or both of them in a good mood and happy with where their life is at when the film jumps forward to another July 15th. Furthermore, the film focuses much more on Dexter than Emma with extensive scenes concerning his alcoholism and career missteps. Emma even authors a successful book and it hardly gets a mention until Dexter happens upon it. This made me wonder that if Dexter was to have so much more attention and screen time than Emma, why all the fuss to make Anne Hathaway British? Since the screenplay was written by the same gentlemen who wrote the novel this film is based on, the story's climax is inevitable even though it is forced and manipulative. The scene is also very poorly shot. The director, Lone Scherfig, who made the brilliant An Education two years ago, completely misses the mark with this scene and the rest of the film suffers for it. The event is set up in a way that even people who venture out and see one movie a year will be able to see what is coming up.Another miscue is Patricia Clarkson's role as Dexter's mother. It feels her role has been severely cut during the editing process. Not only does she have dialogue in the preview which is not in the movie, but she only shows up in about two-three scenes, moves the plot along, and then she's out of there. I have not read the novel, but I guarantee she is a much larger presence on those pages than what seems to be a faint echo of her in this movie.P.S. There is an atrocious Elvis Costello song over the closing credits which destroys any lingering fondness or afterthoughts the audience may have been enjoying during the closing scenes.","4","24 August 2011"
"Ali_John_Catterall","Yes, entirely predictably (well, you probably guessed as much from the trailer), they made an utter pig's ear of it. The Good:As Dex, Jim Sturgess is decent - nails the look, and the accent (both of them). Rafe Spall, as hapless wannabe comedian Ian is also fine - although there isn't a scintilla of genuine anguish about him when he's dumped, but hey, it's not his story right? (To be honest, it's a wonder they didn't simply represent him with a balloon on a stick.)It does have a few reflective moments of stillness, which are incredibly welcome - mostly concerning Dex and family (if the book was arguably slanted more towards Emma's side of the story, here it favours Dex) - but they're all too rare.The Bad:All too rare, because this one zips along like it's left the iron on (no mean feat in an 108 minute movie), galloping toward the denouement so that any emotional investment we might have made in it is almost completely wiped out. 1997, for example, literally lasts a swimming pool length. I know book-to-film adaptations bowdlerise to an extent, but this is absolutely ridiculous. There's also an argument to be made about the wisdom of letting writers adapt their own screenplays. Perhaps some sense of objectivity is lost in the process. Oddly enough, a previous David Nicholls' TV mini-series called 'I Saw You', starring Fay Ripley, is practically a warm-up for One Day, and is absolutely wonderful - very worth tracking down. That was in three parts. If the makers of One Day hadn't been so concerned with making a quick buck (usual story), this would have benefited from a mini-series of its own. But then, of course, there's no money in Telly.At its worst, the film's truncation manifests in a reliance on phone calls between the pair, which makes it seem as if Sturgess is frankly *stalking* Anne Hathaway. *That* twist, at least, is intact, and somewhat shocking. But in the same way a sudden glimpse of a mink being flayed alive in the middle of a Disney cartoon might be.Couldn't they have found one single British actress for crying out loud? Yes, I know only too well about the need for overseas investment. But you're not looking at Anne Hathaway thinking, 'working-class Northener' you're distractedly thinking, 'Isn't that... Anne Hathaway, working in a Tex Mex restaurant in Camden?'Romola Garai, who plays Sophie, would have done better - dressed-down a bit. (Or as often suggested, Carey Mulligan.) And how do they pull off Hathaway being only subtly attractive? Oversize specs. Because, you know, specs always make people look *dowdy*, apparently. I'm not even going to talk about her accent. You've heard it. It ranges from Angela's Ashes to... well, to Hathaway's own American accent, in fact.The Ugly:The more I think about this, the crosser I get. Film Emma never has any tawdry affairs, as in the novel, as it wouldn't suit her martyred character - and it wouldn't suit the fragrant Hathaway. A layered, interesting character becomes a 2-dimensional pouter; pure and nun-like. Just waiting around for Dexter to be ready, waiting for him to finally come around, and save her tormented soul. It's repulsive, actually - and *totally* a betrayal of her character and the spirit of the original. In short, it's not the very worst film in the world - it's just completely and utterly unremarkable; Sub-Richard Curtis, which is something this lovely and moving book just isn't.","5","19 August 2011"
"sdebord3136","I was pleasantly surprised by this film. I thought this was going to be another chick flick with a guy flirting with a girl but I found it was an amazing love story that spans 2 decades and gives a glimpse of what true love could really be. Anne H. was great for this because she is a timeless beauty that played her role through the years wonderfully, and Jim S. did a great job evolving with his character through immaturity to understanding. The European setting was beautiful and added to the scenes from the city to country side building the romance of it all.I wish I would have seen it sooner :)","9","20 November 2011"

Lots of credit goes to David Nicholls for his excellent screenplay. Everything was PERFECT. Timeline, storyline and even the small details was well written. The acting was impeccable too. What about Anne Hathaway's accent? No problems there. Jim Sturgess plays the character Dexter perfectly. Most people would say that The Notebook is the top romantic teary eyed film. I tell them this: One Day is way better. It shows that two people can have friendship, loyalty, affection and love continuously. Watch it.

"juneebuggy","I was a huge fan of the book by David Nicholls and really looked foreword to seeing this... And while it didn't quite live up to my expectations and somewhat failed to capture the love and tragedy of the novel it was still a decent enough romance.The lovely Jim Sturgess plays rich playboy Dexter, with the (mostly irritating) Anne Hathaway as working class woman Em. We join them in 1988 on the night of their college graduation where they almost get together, decide to be friends and then proceed to follow them over the course of the next two decades.We see them through assorted relationships, phone calls, fights, hopes, vacations, missed opportunities, laughter and tears. There is always the anticipation of, will these two ever get together? The tone of the movie is different than the book, trying to be a bit like 'When Harry Met Sally' and failing. I also didn't ever feel the connection between Dexter and Em. I guess I should stop comparing the two, apples and oranges and all that but when you adore a book as much as I did its hard.The ageing of the characters is very well done here, subtle but especially apparent at the very end when the movie flips back to the night they met and you go wow, look how young they were. The clothing is also true to the decade and there are some fun (bad) hairstyles. 1/4/15","8","1 April 2015"
"neil-476","I give advance notice that I am going to be spoilering fairly extensively as this review goes on: you have been warned. Spoiler-free synopsis: Emma and Dexter meet on the day they graduate from university (July 15th 1988): there is an instant connection, and they nearly do the deed, but not quite. Instead, they enter into a long-term friendship which we, the audience, look in on every year on the anniversary of their meeting. Without giving anything away at this point, Emma becomes a waitress and would-be author who takes up with an unsuccessful stand-up comedian, and Dexter becomes a promiscuous TV presenter. We can see that that, ideally, they should be together because Emma desperately loves Dexter, and would be able to turn him from the louche, dissolute rake he has become into the decent man he has the potential to be. But, as the years go by, they always shy away from it. Anne Hathaway plays Emma and Jim Sturgess plays Dexter.Let me comment on a couple of points frequently mentioned elsewhere. One, I had no problem with Anne Hathaway's accent. It was, mostly, a tolerable all purpose moderately well-spoken British accent, with occasional ""oop north"" flattened vowels unnecessarily thrown in. It didn't distract me. Two, I understand that the book is a big hit with a chunk of the audience (the cinema audience was mostly older women in pairs, some with husbands dragged along. I was the only solo male). I haven't read the book, so I have no comment as to how well the film represented it.This film irritated me. I recognise that I am not part of the target demographic for a romantic drama, but I can be reached: my tear glands are perfectly prepared to well up in appropriate circumstances. However, I left the cinema dry-eyed and stony-faced: this film did not touch me in the slightest.I think I was irritated with it right from the start. A young man, subsequently shown to be highly promiscuous, ends up in bed with a girl who is ready and willing, and then - nothing happens? No, I don't think so. From then onwards I was constantly aware of the attempted pushing of emotional manipulation buttons, and it just didn't work. I thought the acting was fine, the period atmosphere good despite the odd anachronism, but I couldn't see why these two totally dissimilar people were soulmates, nor why they kept in touch, what she saw in him - in short, nothing about the emotional side of the film worked for me at all.OK, now I'm going to get really spoilery. And then, after donkeys' years go by, and things go pear shaped for him, Dexter finally learns a bit of humility by which time Emma has found herself a French jazz pianist. She instantly dumps the poor pianist and takes up with Dexter. While trying for a baby of their own (he already has a daughter by a previous relationship), she - really, I'm warning you, stop reading now if you don't want to hit a B.I.G. spoiler - is killed in a traffic accident. We then enter the final section of the film which attempts to have its cake and eat it. Intercut with each other we see Dexter coming to terms with life after Emma's death, in touching (but all not that touching!) conversations with his daughter and Emma's old stand-up comedian boyfriend, plus we see a kind of re-set button version of the day Dexter and Emma first got together which leads us towards the more satisfying relationship they could have had/did have (?) For all these years.And that irritated me even more.I was never uninterested in what went on, but I should have been moved by this film, and I wasn't - and I think it is because it was full of emotional dishonesty from start to finish.","7","26 August 2011"
"jmc4769","I just got back home from seeing this movie, and I feel like I've been hit upside the head with a baseball bat. I'm a sucker for romantic movies, and I've sat through hundreds of mediocre ones that were watchable anyway. But One Day had to be one of the worst romance movies I have ever had the misfortune to endure. It was especially disappointing because I've loved Anne Hathaway in just about everything she's been in (Princess Diaries, Ella Enchanted, Rachel Getting Married, The Devil Wears Prada, Rio, etc.). One Day has few redeeming qualities, except for the occasional pretty scenery. The most serious problem is Jim Sturgess's character, Dexter. Dexter is an unlikable, shallow womanizer. I know what you're thinking: Charming womanizers are a staple of these movies. But Sturgess gives Dexter no charm, no glimmer of humanity, no hint that there may be lovable qualities beneath his contemptible persona. The usually wonderful Hathaway (Emma) gets mired down here in a bad script. And there is not the tiniest spark of chemistry between the two. I kept thinking, ""Come on, Emma, block this loser's number and take out a restraining order."" When the inevitable romance comes, it hasn't a shred of believability. This movie ultimately amounts to a plain Jane wish-fulfillment fantasy (yep, Hathaway is supposed to be plain)...sort of like those movies where the nerdy guy gets the hot girl. The plot structure is a big problem too. We see the main characters only on one day (July 15th) of every year from 1988 to 2011. Instead of continuity, character development, and relationship development, we get mostly uninteresting snippets of their lives. The final straw for me though was the surprise ending, which was a completely gratuitous attempt to insert meaningful drama into an otherwise vacuous movie. At this point, I was begging for the movie to be over, but no such luck. Incredibly, screenwriter (and author of the book of the same name), David Nicholls, drags this bad movie out for another 15 minutes or so.","4","19 August 2011"
"851222","Greetings from Lithuania.I don't watch romantic movies often, but when i heard about story of ""One day"" i thought of giving it a chance. And it sure didn't disappoint me. This is a really good love story, told in a single day in a year in period of 23 years. Movie is beautifully filmed, with great acting by the two leads, especially from Anne Hathaway. She's just so ... beautiful in every meaning of this word. Can't wait to see her next summer in ""TDKR"". ""One day"" isn't your typical Hollywood love story and you can clearly FEEL that watching it. Give this movie a chance and you can be really surprised that when this movie will end, you'll fell your self a little ... brighter.","3","16 October 2011"
"achyutaghosh","Disclaimer first up- biased review, as I am a sucker for love stories.I used to think that Hollywood had stopped making emotionally involving love stories. Thank god they made One Day, then. Based on the best selling book by British author Dave Nicholls, the movie explores the intertwined lives of two protagonists of contrasting nature, yet fated to be together. The premise is novel, with the relationship explored though a peek into 15th July of each year, spread over 22 years. Good stories are brought to life by good acting, and here we have two superb exponents in lead roles- Jim Sturgess as Dexter and Anna Hathaway as Emma. Dexter leads the high profile life, a television anchor with success in all forms chasing him, always. But then his life is also hollow, his friends shallow, and in the end, a faces disillusionment and compromise. Emma dwells in obscurity mostly, but through sheer tenacity and belief achieves a modicum of success as a writer. They meet when they are 18, decide to remain lifelong friends, and they do remain so. In the meanwhile meandering through the vagaries of life, they are inexorably drawn towards each other, dependent on each other.Childhood sweethearts, even if long lost, when they do come together, they do get together without any questions asked- i say this having witnessed the same on a close friend of mine. And you cant help but fall in love with Emma and Dexter- their love story is so compelling and adorable, that you become a part of their story, you care for them, you laugh with them, and also cry, you want them to do what you would do, and yes, you desperately want a happy ending for them.And of course there is Anna Hathaway-suitably rumpled and grunge in the first half, and elegance and grace personified in the second, when she flashes her pearly whites, the world seems to be a better place to live.Why do people in love get to be in love in the best of locations? One Day happens in picturesque Edinburgh, colourful London, and stylish Paris. And the best thing that makes it stand out among all love stories is that it is not predictable, till the very end. People and things change with time, but memories remain the same.- here's a movie that raises a toast to happy memories, a Must watch for mushy folks!","3","23 November 2011"
"Philby-3","One Day Two eighties graduates in Edinburgh have an encounter on graduation day, July 15th ; the film follows their relationship by annual updates. Dexter (Jim Sturgess) brilliant, charismatic and a total narcissist and Emma (Ann Hathaway), a demure, warm sort are not a great match and both hitch up with others, but their friendship endures.The film is romantic, but only to a point, and can hardly be described as a comedy; there is too much pain for that, despite some funny dialogue. It is a kind of growing older movie – early promise turning sour, bright young ambitious things tasting failure and settling for something less. The story is cleverly told and nicely shot, with good support from Ken Stott and Patricia Clarkson as Dexter's disapproving parents and Rhys Spall as Emma's husband. Jim Sturgess looks and acts uncannily like a younger Rupert Graves, who has portrayed a long line of charming handsome wastrels. Ann Hathaway might be from New York but she plays Emma perfectly – the dialect coaches really earned their money. Both of the principals manage to evoke our sympathy, though Sturgess has the harder job.July 15 is St Swithin's day. On that day in 1415 the English Army led by Henry V (alias Laurence Olivier or Kenneth Branagh) defeated a larger French force at Agincourt. This has absolutely nothing to do with the movie though Dexter and Emma do at one stage venture to Brittany, where they manage to lose their clothes in one of the film's more comedic moments.I couldn't help feeling the story arc was rather predictable but I was absorbed nonetheless. At the end I'm not sure what the attraction was for Emma – she was smart enough to realise Dexter was a jerk but somehow she couldn't resist. He does get better – perhaps deep down she wanted to reform him. Or perhaps deep down she wanted to be a bit wild too. A film for generation Xers who are wondering what the hell happened to their youthful dreams and plans.","8","14 September 2011"
"napierslogs","""One Day"", based on the novel of the same name, is the relationship of two people, Emma (Anne Hathaway) and Dexter (Jim Sturgess), as we see it on July 15th of each year. As can be expected from the nature of the story, it's a little dry, lacking in comedy. But then again, it's a romantic drama, not a romantic comedy.As is the nature of the two media, movies can never be exactly the same as the novel. But the problem with this one is that they tried to; no story lines were removed. Almost everything was there, just shortened into mostly meaningless segments. I personally could have done with one less event in their lives, and perhaps a different ending, but they tried to be as faithful as possible.What we have here is a movie about a relationship, but the novel was about the people. They traded in character depth and development so we can see them in their more attractive years falling in and out of love.I wasn't very familiar with Jim Sturgess, having seen him play skinny, slightly nerdy, not as confident kids. Dexter is a different breed of guy. Just has high on self-confidence as he is on drugs and alcohol, he gets by on his looks – literally – he's a TV host. Although the different characteristics of Dexter weren't explicitly shown in the movie, Sturgess brought them out in him perfectly. Emma is a more complex character, with significant evolution to who she is throughout the years, except none of that is in the movie, so it just wasn't really possible for Hathaway to portray her as a more interesting person.I would assume that watching ""One Day"" without the benefit of having read the novel would be a fairly confusing, empty experience. With the background that the novel gave me, I could fill in all the missing years and the unexplored layers to the characters, so there was still something to their relationship for me.","10","19 August 2011"
"TheBobbyjames","Very seldom in Hollywood are movies produced that are as emotionally involving as 'One Day.' It's a beautiful, beautiful love story of two people, Emma (Anne Hathaway) and Dex (Jim Sturgess). After spending the night together after graduation, we are taken on a journey into their lives for one day each year after they met; to see where they are or where they're not. Based on the book by David Nicholls (who also wrote the screenplay), 'One Day' transitions from novel to film brilliantly.First let me say film acting is what I believe makes or breaks a movie - if the actors are great, the movie is generally great. That's not to take away from any other element of film at all, but when everything else is done so well, if the acting were bad, the film would have been less memorable. But Anne Hathaway and Jim Sturgess are so very impressive here. They make their characters real and relatable, which are two key things every actor internally wishes they could do. In fact, as an on-screen pair, they work extremely well, together they exude chemistry.What I found most interesting about the entire experience was that I cared so much. I became enamoured with their lives. I kept hoping for the best. I anticipated what would happen to each of them. I sat forward, sat backward. I laughed and I cried. I've said many times before, a great movie will effect you emotionally in more ways than one. You'll be angry, you'll be happy, you'll be sad - the key is that you emote. This movie presented all of those elements. It was fresh and witty and everything you hope a movie will be. It's as beautifully made as it is acted and the locations are exquisite. Far too often, characters in Hollywood seem contrived and are not genuine. 'One Day' is honestly one of the most genuine stories ever told - there is no instant gratification, there is however frustration and that is the beauty of it all. It explores love and love lost, it explores friendship and the constraints of time and distance. It explores each character's journey to happiness and the trials they face along the way. So many little pieces of the puzzle are filled in between the years by simple, single lines of dialogue or actions. It's not the typical script of ""everything's all good-obstacle-everything ends well"" - there's a lot more complexity which makes it realistically genuine.So many little details, like eye-lines, smiles, sighs, cut-off conversations, etc. were paid attention to. The costuming, cinematography and score were spot on and all noteworthy. All of it combined was moving and awe-inspiring. I left the theater crying, but it didn't stop there, even thinking about the movie and those characters is deeply affecting. Maybe there are some underlying themes in the film that I'm identifying with, or maybe, just maybe the actors were really that great. Whatever it is, this film comes with my highest recommendation, is rated PG-13 and runs 107 minutes.","9","31 August 2011"
"TheLittleSongbird","The book was a wonderful read. One Day was a movie I was looking forward to, and while it was disappointing I found it very pleasant.What made the book so good and such a joy to read was not just the emotional impact, modern angst and characterisation but also how nostalgic it made me. The emotional impact and angst is here in the movie, what wasn't quite there was the nostalgia-evidence of it but could've been more- and characterisation which does feel choppy especially with Patricia Clarkson's Alison though Dexter is well realised.That said, I loved the beautiful look of the film, the soundtrack which gave the film its sense of nostalgia and the witty banter between Sturgess and Hathaway. The romantic elements are touching though the comedic elements don't always work coming across as a tad contrived. The direction is decent, the telling of the story is well paced(if somewhat glacial) and faithful and the script has some nice touches but also some weak ones. Of the support performances I thought Rafe Spall, Romola Garai and Ken Stott were the most effective and Clarkson was good if deserving of more to do. The picture belongs to Jim Sturgess, while staying true to his bad boy character of Dexter he also manages to be sympathetic.My feelings on Anne Hathaway were mixed. I loved her radiance and her chemistry with Sturgess, but her accent was inconsistent and felt forced and unnatural whenever she tried it. The shock ending also felt more bewildering than anything else, not the actual tragedy itself but rather the flashbacks that succeeded that I wasn't sure was really needed.In conclusion, pleasant if not entirely successful. 6.5/10 Bethany Cox","8","31 August 2011"
"JimmyCollins","Words cannot describe how wonderful an actress Anne Hathaway is, and in One Day she is in fine form, if there ever was an actress to go down in the history books among the greats it would be her. Jim Sturgess is quite a charming devil swell.The story that takes place in One Day is at moments the anti love story and other times a sweeping epic romance, even though this movie has been adapted from a book it's still a lot more original than other romantic themed films of late. Lone Scherfig definitely suits this style of English romance, starting with An Education and now this, it may sound mean but I just don't think the romantic dramas that come from the U.S have the same genuine feel that the English films do.I had read the book and i have to say that this is a very loyal adaptation, much of the beauty from the book is clear and present here, particularly the friendship aspect between Dex and Emma, in the book it's a quirky kind of friendship and it transferred well on the screen as, I was very pleased that the film makers didn't ruin that with a cheap silly sexual type of friendship.I could say a lot about how lovely this movie is but I think I'll let everyone make up their own mind. A lot of people have a bad opinion of this movie which I find baffling but I suppose each to their own, I just got totally wrapped up in this gorgeous romance.10 out of 10","1","3 September 2011"
"queen_of_naboo88","I went to see One Day last night, and though I had been looking forward to it for a while, I was surprised at how good it actually is. The film has a very unique atmosphere, as it is much quirkier than your average romance. Also, without giving away the ending, I can say that it isn't as predictable as one might think. What I really liked about it was the complexity of the different human relationships that we are shown. The relationship between Emma and Dexter is by no means an easy one, nor is it one-sided. Given how different they are, there is a lot of conflict between them, although they do love each other. Similarly, what Dexter and his ex-wife feel for one another is never pure hatred, but there is a lot of understanding between them. As a consequence, the story seems like it could be taken from real life. Plus, both Hathaway and Sturgess are as convincing as always, which makes this film absolutely worth seeing.","9","19 August 2011"
"guest_pabby","After perusing other reviews for this movie, I believe that many of the ratings are low, not because viewers disliked the movie, but because they disliked the element in which the film shines. The film succeeds in drawing the audience into the friendship between the main characters, played by Jim Sturgess and Anne Hathaway. Both characters find happiness and meaning in parts of their lives, while suffering through other portions without attaining goals they've set for themselves; i.e., this is real life.What the poorly-rating reviewers seek is escapism. In my view--however limited--this film aims to depict two human beings as they learn, grow, and fall in and out of touch with one another. Thus, don't expect any fairy tales here and don't punish the rating on this movie because it isn't a fairy tale! A predictable conclusion to this movie would place Sturgess and Hathaway side by side, married, and living together untouched by the trials of a realistic relationship. Instead, the director effectively and with calculation showcases some of life in the scenes and merely hints at events not shown on the screen. As the film narrates exclusively through one date each year (hence, the name), partial narratives are expected. The final third of the film, shunned by a few reviewers, elevated the creative vision of the story because it introduces the unpredictable nature of real life into a movie that was otherwise a run-of-the-mill romance. Again, speaking in terms of the development between characters, the movie is above average. Speaking in terms of storyline, the first two-thirds, to a certain degree, lack what the final third delivers: surprise! The juxtaposition of the present with the past near the end of this film makes the events even more potent than they would have been. Audience members who do not fall into the ""half-wit"" category can follow the story, regardless of what the viewers who read the novel state in their reviews. Bravo! Lastly, Anne Hathaway is exceedingly lovely.","8","3 September 2011"
"ferguson-6","Greetings again from the darkness. I have not read David Nicholls' novel, but my understanding is that it is extremely well written and its loyal readers really connected with Emma and Dexter. If that's true, then this film version is even worse than I thought while watching.This literally is my least favorite type of movie. A movie that assumes its viewers are unable to think for themselves or judge the actions of its characters. In other words, the filmmakers take for granted that we will accept whatever is shown on the big screen.First let me say that I completely understand the school girl crush that a young Emma (Anne Hathaway) has on her classmate Dexter (Jim Sturgess). He is handsome and charismatic and comes from more money than she. I also understand Dexter's attraction to the lovely Emma. She is very pretty - despite the ridiculous over-sized glasses for the early scenes - and very intelligent, and a significantly nicer person than he.What makes absolutely no sense to me is her continued attraction to this drunken, empty soul for the next twenty years. She is too smart to pine away the years hoping he will wise up and coming running to her. We are supposed to believe that she has no interest in any other relationship other than the non-threatening one with flopping stand-up comedian Ian (played by Timothy Spall's son Rafe) and a ""boring"" French Jazz Pianist.Dexter's mother is played by Patricia Clarkson. As she is dying from cancer, she tells him that she believes he will grow into a good man, but isn't there yet. I guess we are supposed to take her word for it. Instead we only see Dexter go from a selfish pig as a TV personality to a defeated man who must perform manual labor for the first time in his life. My issue is that a defeated man is not necessarily a good man. A man resigned to his life has not necessarily reached enlightenment. Where is Emma's proof that he deserves her? Where is the indication that her life with him will be better? I tell you where ... in the mind of that school girl from years ago.Please don't mistake my words as that of one who has no faith in romantic stories. There are so many ways this story could have turned that it would have had me. Instead it chose a path that assumed I was ignorant ... totally accepting of ridiculous story being laid out for me.My final comments on the film involve the cast. Anne Hathaway is an incredibly talented performer. She is not, however, British. Her accent is terribly distracting. Jim Sturgess is a handsome guy, but just not charismatic enough to pull off the TV personality role. Patricia Clarkson is a fantastic actress, but she is not British either. Seriously, are there not enough British actresses? The casting smells like a money-grubbing production team. As for director Lone Scherfig ... her previous film An Education was cinematic excellence. This is an unacceptable follow-up and we expect better next time.I will say the locations of Edinburg, London and Paris were beautiful and different than we usually get from the movies. That provided the only real enjoyment from this highly disappointing movie.","6","21 August 2011"
"Rob-O-Cop","this had some great aspects to it but ultimately failed to deliver. Firstly the good. Brilliant locations, beautiful cinematography, Anne Hathaway delivers a good performance,The bad. The editor and the director failed to establish a believable connection between the two lead actors as to why they would form a lasting bond that would carry them over 20 years. We're given a hint of this at the end but that doesn't help or fix the rest of the movie, so that's the bad editing aspect of this. if this scene had been at the front it might have helped sell the movie. That that scene didn't really deliver the goods needed to make it believable is the directors mistake along with many of the other scenes that tips the scale against the characters. Too many scenes of Dexter being a jerk and not enough of him being in anyway lovable or charming, even though there was much amusement to be had in the jerk Dexter scenes they blew out the balance of his character and it wasn't till the end that we got to see him as anything less than a jerk, but by then it was too late and it didn't really do anything to alter the confusion of why Emma would have cared. I also didn't buy Jim Sturgess performance, although a lot of people think differently, he came across as a caricature rather than a character. People have criticised Anne Hathaway's accent and there's probably some weight to that but I personally didn't find it annoying once I thought what's going on with her accent as it fluctuated all over the show. That's a continuity and a direction flaw as much as it is her performance. After a few mins I put it in the multi-sourced accent file as many people have blended accents. Outside of that Anne's delivering some really good depth in her work so much so that we may one day forgive her for the princess diaries.","10","27 January 2012"
"francine-k","I had watched ""One Day"" yesterday and was beyond excited because I had read the novel by David Nicholls, which was fantastic. The movie base's around 2 people and their twenty years together, shown only through one day, July 15th. I thought the plot was unique and was a very realistic romance. Sometimes it takes people a lot to lose to realize what life is about, and how certain people are truly important to you. The movie was cute, funny, and quite sad at times. I thought Anne Hathaway did an okay job on the accent, to me it was odd at first but after a couple minutes I had gotten used to it. Her acting was great and you can really see her changing as the years progress. Jim Sturgess was great and in my opinion really portrayed Dexter the best as possible, with the arrogance and attitude exactly as I imagined Dexter would have. In my own opinion the movie was a great watch, was a romance that I had been dying for ever sense The Notebook. Finally a tear jerking but smile at the end movie, that really anyone can enjoy, if your looking for a romance movie.","7","20 August 2011"
"JohnDeSando","One Day is promoted as drama romance and not a rom com. On all three counts I would call it out anyway, for it is a melodramatic, episodic tale of two best friends in London, Emma (Anne Hathaway) and Dexter (Jim Sturgess), who flirt with love over a long period but play on the standard cliché that requires they eventually end up together, regardless how many marriages and children intervene.One Day has too many short episodes from college in the '80's until professional life in 2011, and each seems just a variation on another before it: boy gets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl back again, well, you know the routine. During all these little skirmishes Emma remains wholesome (no stretch for the perpetually cute Hathaway, reminding me of Sally Hawkins' Poppy in Mike Leigh's Happy Go Lucky. But without Hawkins' charisma).Dexter is a cad and Lothario almost all the way, making him unlikeable and difficult to gain our sympathy. His cavalier treatment of his mother (the ever-interesting Patricia Clarkson) and father (Ken Stott) adds to his surly persona. In addition, Sturgess needs a little coaching or better script if he wishes to catch up with the Ryans (Gosling and Reynolds) in the emerging leading-man lineup.Nowhere do I feel a real sexual heat, especially since in most of the film they are avowing to be just friends. Moreover in the numerous years/episodes I do not feel the intellectual and emotional connection that comes so naturally in Richard Linklater's Before Sunrise/Sunset series. Even director Lone Scherfig's Parisian scenes are vacant, poor cousins to Woody Allen's romantic City of Lights in Midnight in Paris.As an Anglophile, I usually can forgive many sins if a film gives me an adequate dose of the great city, but as with the Paris background, romance takes a holiday even from the cities.","10","23 August 2011"
"blanbrn","Over the summer I saw this film sure it's typical chick flick, still as a male I admire the beauty and sexy look of Anne Hathaway who I think is a brilliant actress. Plus I think she pulled the international accent off just fine in this film and as always her look is sharp and just fine. This is a love story that spans time with memories these moments touch you staying with you forever despite when an unexpected tragedy strikes.Set in England it involves a couple Em(Anne Hathaway) and Dexter(Jim Sturgess) and after this international couple graduates from college and meet and fall for one another on July 15, 1989. From every year on on this date it's considered an anniversary for this couple as the film shows the special moments that happened during the lives of both. As each year on the same day is highlighted you see that no matter what path their lives have taken love and memories draw them together.Overall this is a film of memory and everlasting love sadly an unexpected tragedy occurs, but still with memories Dexter will love Em forever as long as memories are around love can last forever. Probably not a great film but worth a watch for any Anne Hathaway fan.","9","10 October 2011"
"jeffallenhammer","Does life imitate art or does art imitate life? I'm one who tends to avoid the discussion entirely by saying ""both."" One Day is the most real (save a few accents) movie I've seen in a long time. It explores time and how it often slips away from us. Our hearts' desires are often decimated by bad timing, and the movie finds a variety of ways to demonstrate this. So in the case of One Day, art imitates life to the fullest, as we can all sympathize (if only a little) to crushed hopes and shattered dreams, though hopefully we eventually find our way.Anne Hathaway stars as insecure working-class woman Emma, who, for one reason or another is drawn to Dexter, (Jim Sturgess) a charming upper middle class man with a great amount of self-confidence. It may be hard to understand just what the two have on each other, but they are characters I'm familiar with. The woman who is way too into a man that's way too into himself, it happens and for the type, Dex is pretty likable. Em and Dex have nothing in common. But their opposite personalities do what a relationship should; make each other better. They are Yin and Yang, complementary opposites.An interesting technique used by One Day, is that we only get to see the events of a single day, July 15, for each of 20 plus years. Some of my peers have taken to calling this a gimmick. In a year where it seems every other film is either a sequel or a remake/reboot, (which critics and public alike have grown tired of) I feel fresh ideas should be applauded, even if it doesn't quite work. For me, however, it worked to perfection. Director Lone Scherfig (An Education) paints the picture of Em and Dex's up and down relationship with great finesse, never having too much happen on the date year to year. The filmmaker fills us in on what has taken place throughout each year, without conversations seeming inorganic. The cinematography is beautiful, especially a scene where our would-be lovers break all their rules by taking a dip at sunset. There's plenty of humor, joy, sadness, regret and a number of other emotions to be felt. I caution viewers that this isn't a romantic comedy, nor does it end like one. One Day is, however, easily one of the most heartfelt films of the year and should be celebrated for its bravery.","9","31 August 2011"
"fernandoschiavi","Based on David Nichols' bestseller, ""One Day"" is a more mature Nicholas Sparks version, but equally tearful and melodramatic. Based on a peculiar and intriguing narrative structure, which revisits the 15th of July in the lives of Dexter and Emma since 1988 over more than 20 years, the story focuses on the maturation of the relationship between its characters, fleeing the punctuality and immediacy that surrounds most novels. Ironically, this same artifice reveals the main weakness of the script - others will be seen in the following paragraphs - because the annual reunion with the characters does not hide the considerable loss of information that motivated sudden changes in the life and behavior of each one.Sensitively directed by the Danish Lone Scherfig (""Education""), who delicately builds the fluid dynamic between Dexter and Emma (Hathaway), One Day is skillful in establishing the passage of time also with the aid of an impeccable make-up job - and notice how Sturgess, in particular, goes from a smooth-faced, jovial boy to a weary middle-aged man with wrinkles and bags under his eyes, while Hathaway emerges chubby (but not exaggeratedly so) after working two years as a waitress in a Mexican restaurant, which is an interesting detail. Benefiting from a competent cast that creates equally complex secondary characters that help compose the journey of the main couple (worth mentioning Rafe Spall, son of Timothy, who transforms the aspiring comedian Ian into a man that is simultaneously pathetic and moving), the film fails here and there by investing in stereotyped characterizations, but still avoiding that they dominate the narrative - and if Dexter's father appears as the typical ""cold and critical father"", Ken Stott manages to make him softer through occasional hesitations that point out his internal effort to try to get closer to the child.Likewise, if Nicholls' dialogues are occasionally forced to appeal to exposition in order to clarify what happened to the characters in the previous year, this is balanced by the good construction of so many other lines (especially those spoken by Hathaway), which they display the cold irony typical of British humor (Emma at one point describes the restaurant where she works as a ""graveyard of ambitions""). As if that were not enough, the script also creates really sensitive interactions between those people, highlighting the brief and beautiful scene between Dexter and his mother, who, played by Patricia Clarkson, shows melancholy and love when telling her son that, even certain that he will be a good man, realizes that he ""isn't there yet"".The dialogues are a strong point of the script, also written by David Nicholls. They are fast, with intelligent insights and manage to perfectly translate the personality of each character and their relationships with each other. Even with silly jokes, like Dexter's mother in Paris saying to her son, ""look over there, Alain Delon"" ... or not, it's your father"", demonstrating how much she is in love with her husband. There are funny scenes too, like when Dexter plays the most famous scene of Spartacus with the dolls for his daughter. But no character is better translated by the dialogues than Emma, the shy girl, but extremely intelligent and sagacious. Each of her lines is a bit of her temperament, feeling, spontaneity.However, it is even in the construction of Dexter and Emma that ""One Day"" proves to be particularly efficient: while the boy quickly achieves professional success, the girl struggles for years trying to make her artistic aspirations viable - a situation that gradually reverses as that we perceive that the former lacks the intellectual, emotional and psychological content that sustains his career, while Emma, growing from suffering, reflection and the simple experience of life, gradually transforms herself into a mature woman and ready to overcome the obstacles that previously prevented it from moving forward (and Sturgess and Hathaway, talented and charismatic, confidently illustrate these changes).The problem is that Hathaway's character quickly becomes the link with the audience. The dreamy sweetness, the sweetness and the detachment transform Emma into a very pleasant company, something that Dexter cannot see. Unsympathetic, self-centered and narcissistic, he uses Emma more as someone to quench the loneliness caused by her personality and assuage her pain and addictions than as a true friendship. Played by the expressionless Sturgess and his characteristic face of suffering, it is practically impossible to believe the beautiful and sensitive Emma fell in love with the guy after a disastrous dinner in which he exposes her (dis)interest. In this way, she emerges as the tragic anchor of the narrative, surrendering herself to the loves of a person she does not love, just to fill the sentimental need. What is revealed in the most cliché of sentences, enunciated according to the Nicholas Sparks booklet: ""she made him decent; you made her happy"".As Emma and Dexter mature, the adolescent, dreamy and inconsequential traits give way to realistic, cynical and disillusioned versions, propelled by tragedies, some of them approached with excessive disregard and disengagement due to the narrative structure - yet another negative effect of this. Elevated to the status of protagonist, an incorrect and questionable decision, Dexter undergoes a wide dramatic arc from his mother's illness (Clarkson), the cancellation of the television program, his marriage to Sylvie (Romola Garai, the young woman from ""Desire and Reparation"" and increasingly better actress), to an event that would definitely humanize him. At times, Emma's life is described in terms of her dream of becoming a writer or her relationship with Ian (Rafe Spall), which is disappointing.By scrutinizing and dissecting fractions of those characters' lives, certain moments should be more appropriately explored in David Nicholls' script. Dexter's firing after a botched interview and being hired on a video game show lacks a glimpse into the character's journey, though we understand what led to this precipitous fall. Similarly, Emma's relationship with Ian, presented at a dinner party without sparks or the guy's inability to make jokes, culminates in the explanation that she can't ""take him watching Wrath of Khan every day anymore"". This excessive exposition becomes constant in the film, requiring that a character needs to contextualize the events that are taking place to the public, which exposes the artificiality of the undertaking; well, if Emma and Dexter are such good friends, it was expected that he would reveal the bad news in the expected time and not months later.On the other hand, the annual narrative is well explored by Danish director Lone Scherfig, and the use of raccords and ellipses in Barney Pilling's montage stands out. And not just temporality, but the duo of characters allows Benoît Delhomme's photography to individualize Emma's trajectory in a nostalgic sepia, while Dexter is bathed in a depressing bluish color palette. Finally, Rachel Portman's score avoids being too intrusive, competently punctuating the narrative. Yes, the idea is curious and the narrative exercise valid (albeit flawed). The trajectory of two people is drawn before our eyes and, let's face it, it's not something usual in novel production. It is a pity, therefore, that the chosen 15th of July sounds hopelessly clichéd and expositional, making the unknown 364 remaining days of each year seem more interesting by comparison.We cannot, however, say that the film is not romantic. It has its moments, even if it prepares us to tears in such an obvious and brief way. Soon we will be in the next year, and the year after that, forgetting the pain and moving on. But that doesn't stop us from living in the moment. They are brief, it is true, but true and well-constructed. Especially in the final act, where we desperately want to go back to the beginning, as an attempt to remake the story, or at least fool our minds with that simple encounter in the middle of the street and a kiss seals the love story that should have been. Director Lone Scherfig managed to bring delicacy to the story of Emma and Dexter, making ""One Day"" a sensitive film. A love story built without resources common to films of this nature. Everything is almost realistic and fearful as life. She regrets that, when the situation picks up, she pulls the rug out from under us, with a cliché situation, announced, made just to make us cry. And she didn't even make it. Still, a good movie of its kind.","4","12 May 2023"
"Likes_Ninjas90","In the late 80s a girl named Emma (Anne Hathaway) is a college student who meets fellow graduate Dexter (Jim Sturgess). They're about to sleep together one evening but decide to remain friends instead. Over the course of twenty years we see how circumstances and other people have kept them divided when they just want to be together. Dexter finds himself hosting a ghastly television show, while being warned by his sick mother (Patricia Clarkson) that he isn't a particularly nice person anymore. He insists that he just wants to have fun, despite being critically panned and moving between women. Emma works her way up from a job in a fast food restaurant, to a teacher and then eventually into a successful author. To the distress of Dexter she has a serious relationship with an obnoxious comedian, which puts her real desires on hold. Late in the timeline, Dexter is married rather unhappily and has a baby girl to look after. An unlikeable leading man makes this one day too many. It's impossible to say what type of movie One Day is. It postures as a comedy but it barely raises a single laugh. And though it also lacks dramatic impact for much of its length too, its one climax is so shocking and over the top that it will leave a sour taste in your mouth. Do not consider this as a date movie. You will not be popular. You also have to wonder late in the movie what the point was. Director Lone Scherfig (An Education, 2009) tries to end things on a very syrupy note. That's very nice for one of the characters but unrewarding for the audience who have waded through twenty years in the lives of these unappealing characters for nothing. The message is ultimately a very obvious, unoriginal and simple one: that life pulls people in opposite directions but happiness can be found in one single moment. Using an extended chronological structure is a gimmick. It allows for little on screen titles to appear in the frame, just like in (500) Days of Summer (2009) but it refuses to enrich character. A film like Blue Valentine (2010) is infinitively more intelligent because it realises that character is structure. It contrasts the past and present day to visualise the changing personalities of its leads and the impact on their relationship. The script by David Nicholls, adapting his own novel, lacks this kind of sophistication. Having the film move through such an extensive period suggests that there will be arching transformations in the characters. But unfortunately Sturgess remains continuously unlikeable all throughout this movie. His character is arrogant, rude, promiscuous and irresponsible. And briefly touching on his fractured relationship with his parents does not make him anymore sympathetic. Patricia Clarkson is barely in this movie because she has so few scenes and I wasn't moved by her appearances as the film intended. One of the golden rules of the romantic comedy is broken here: you don't understand why Emma and Dexter belong together. This is a detriment to the film's plotting and the motives of the characters. We're left wondering what this apparently sophisticated woman continues to see in this buffoon, especially when she's already with better company. Even after that huge climax Dexter still has a moment of madness. Only at the very end does he wake up to himself. The actors aren't really to blame. Anne Hathaway is such a pleasant actress in almost everything she does, comedy or otherwise. But this sketchy, underwritten role wastes her talents and doesn't stretch her chops at all. She's made to look dorky and uptight with her over-sized glasses, only to move into little but quirkiness. And Jim Sturgess who I liked in Across the Universe (2007) and The Way Back (2010) is gifted too, with no shortage of personality. He just happens to be playing a real jerk. If that's what he intended, he certainly succeeded. As far as the rebirth of frank romantic-comedies goes this is a pretty uninspired and limp entry.","5","24 August 2011"
"ianlouisiana","Here in the UK we call people like this ""Up themselves""and I can't think of a film where that description of the characters is more applicable.
One frankly poisonous bloke with his brains in his pants tries for 20 - odd years to seduce a girl he was at university with.
That,basically,is what ""One Day"" is all about.
It's not a love story for heaven sake,he is pathologically incapable of feeling so complex an emotion.
Except towards himself.
She wastes a significant proportion of her life waiting for him to change into a completely different person then,quite inexplicably decides she'll take him on as he is.Maybe she is hearing her biological clock.ticking.
Whatever,she dumps her French jazz pianist boyfriend so quickly he hardly has time to learn the melodic minor scale.
The device on which ""One Day"" hangs is so flimsy I lost interest very early on.
It might have been more winning if the writer had made the ""One Day"" the 29th February - at least it would have been over sooner.
All you need to know about the characters is that they play the terribly posh game ""Are you there,Moriarty"",an Oxbridge version of Blind Man's Buff with added violence .
Under the guise of which the seriously unpleasant guy smacks his girlfriend very hard in the face with a rolled up newspaper,causing her nose to bleed.
She(the lovely Romelai Garai - by far the best performance)still marries him and has his baby.
Well,I never said they were clever.","9","25 February 2018"
"chaz-28","There is a lingering and persistent distraction throughout One Day which severely impairs the audience from becoming absorbed in the film. This is Anne Hathaway's atrocious accent. Many Americans have at varying degrees in the past successfully pulled off a believable British accent. However, Anne Hathaway's character, Emma Morley, sounds at different times Irish, Scottish, and American, but never British. It truly was irritating after awhile. Why didn't the filmmakers just cast a British actress? Or, if they were dead set on Hathaway playing Emma, then move the whole story to America. If not for the distracting aural miscues, this film would most likely be much more enjoyable.Emma and Dexter (Jim Sturgess) meet the night of college graduation at the tail end of an all night party. This is not a meet-cute either. They are the only two left as the last couple pairs off with each other; therefore, fate has thrown them together to have a one night stand. Things get in the way and they end up deciding to be friends and start a very long platonic relationship. This is mostly convincing as Emma is seen to be truly infatuated with Dexter who does not see her in the same light, in fact, he treats her rather poorly as the years go by. Graduation night was July 15th by the way so naturally the pair concocts a plan to meet up annually on that day or at least check in my telephone if this is not possible.Surprisingly, every July 15th is actually a pretty horrible, sad day for each of them. Very rarely is one or both of them in a good mood and happy with where their life is at when the film jumps forward to another July 15th. Furthermore, the film focuses much more on Dexter than Emma with extensive scenes concerning his alcoholism and career missteps. Emma even authors a successful book and it hardly gets a mention until Dexter happens upon it. This made me wonder that if Dexter was to have so much more attention and screen time than Emma, why all the fuss to make Anne Hathaway British? Since the screenplay was written by the same gentlemen who wrote the novel this film is based on, the story's climax is inevitable even though it is forced and manipulative. The scene is also very poorly shot. The director, Lone Scherfig, who made the brilliant An Education two years ago, completely misses the mark with this scene and the rest of the film suffers for it. The event is set up in a way that even people who venture out and see one movie a year will be able to see what is coming up.Another miscue is Patricia Clarkson's role as Dexter's mother. It feels her role has been severely cut during the editing process. Not only does she have dialogue in the preview which is not in the movie, but she only shows up in about two-three scenes, moves the plot along, and then she's out of there. I have not read the novel, but I guarantee she is a much larger presence on those pages than what seems to be a faint echo of her in this movie.P.S. There is an atrocious Elvis Costello song over the closing credits which destroys any lingering fondness or afterthoughts the audience may have been enjoying during the closing scenes.","7","24 August 2011"
"Ali_John_Catterall","Yes, entirely predictably (well, you probably guessed as much from the trailer), they made an utter pig's ear of it. The Good:As Dex, Jim Sturgess is decent - nails the look, and the accent (both of them). Rafe Spall, as hapless wannabe comedian Ian is also fine - although there isn't a scintilla of genuine anguish about him when he's dumped, but hey, it's not his story right? (To be honest, it's a wonder they didn't simply represent him with a balloon on a stick.)It does have a few reflective moments of stillness, which are incredibly welcome - mostly concerning Dex and family (if the book was arguably slanted more towards Emma's side of the story, here it favours Dex) - but they're all too rare.The Bad:All too rare, because this one zips along like it's left the iron on (no mean feat in an 108 minute movie), galloping toward the denouement so that any emotional investment we might have made in it is almost completely wiped out. 1997, for example, literally lasts a swimming pool length. I know book-to-film adaptations bowdlerise to an extent, but this is absolutely ridiculous. There's also an argument to be made about the wisdom of letting writers adapt their own screenplays. Perhaps some sense of objectivity is lost in the process. Oddly enough, a previous David Nicholls' TV mini-series called 'I Saw You', starring Fay Ripley, is practically a warm-up for One Day, and is absolutely wonderful - very worth tracking down. That was in three parts. If the makers of One Day hadn't been so concerned with making a quick buck (usual story), this would have benefited from a mini-series of its own. But then, of course, there's no money in Telly.At its worst, the film's truncation manifests in a reliance on phone calls between the pair, which makes it seem as if Sturgess is frankly *stalking* Anne Hathaway. *That* twist, at least, is intact, and somewhat shocking. But in the same way a sudden glimpse of a mink being flayed alive in the middle of a Disney cartoon might be.Couldn't they have found one single British actress for crying out loud? Yes, I know only too well about the need for overseas investment. But you're not looking at Anne Hathaway thinking, 'working-class Northener' you're distractedly thinking, 'Isn't that... Anne Hathaway, working in a Tex Mex restaurant in Camden?'Romola Garai, who plays Sophie, would have done better - dressed-down a bit. (Or as often suggested, Carey Mulligan.) And how do they pull off Hathaway being only subtly attractive? Oversize specs. Because, you know, specs always make people look *dowdy*, apparently. I'm not even going to talk about her accent. You've heard it. It ranges from Angela's Ashes to... well, to Hathaway's own American accent, in fact.The Ugly:The more I think about this, the crosser I get. Film Emma never has any tawdry affairs, as in the novel, as it wouldn't suit her martyred character - and it wouldn't suit the fragrant Hathaway. A layered, interesting character becomes a 2-dimensional pouter; pure and nun-like. Just waiting around for Dexter to be ready, waiting for him to finally come around, and save her tormented soul. It's repulsive, actually - and *totally* a betrayal of her character and the spirit of the original. In short, it's not the very worst film in the world - it's just completely and utterly unremarkable; Sub-Richard Curtis, which is something this lovely and moving book just isn't.","8","19 August 2011"
"sdebord3136","I was pleasantly surprised by this film. I thought this was going to be another chick flick with a guy flirting with a girl but I found it was an amazing love story that spans 2 decades and gives a glimpse of what true love could really be. Anne H. was great for this because she is a timeless beauty that played her role through the years wonderfully, and Jim S. did a great job evolving with his character through immaturity to understanding. The European setting was beautiful and added to the scenes from the city to country side building the romance of it all.I wish I would have seen it sooner :)","7","20 November 2011"
"axxmy_one","People keep saying that movie adaptations from novels are usually not the same. Some are bad, some are okay, but in this case, it was beautiful. Lots of credit goes to David Nicholls for his excellent screenplay. Everything was PERFECT. Timeline, storyline and even the small details was well written. The acting was impeccable too. What about Anne Hathaway's accent? No problems there. Jim Sturgess plays the character Dexter perfectly. Most people would say that The Notebook is the top romantic teary eyed film. I tell them this: One Day is way better. It shows that two people can have friendship, loyalty, affection and love continuously. Watch it. Whether you have read the book or not, you will fall in love with Dexter & Emma !","4","24 November 2011"
"juneebuggy","I was a huge fan of the book by David Nicholls and really looked foreword to seeing this... And while it didn't quite live up to my expectations and somewhat failed to capture the love and tragedy of the novel it was still a decent enough romance.The lovely Jim Sturgess plays rich playboy Dexter, with the (mostly irritating) Anne Hathaway as working class woman Em. We join them in 1988 on the night of their college graduation where they almost get together, decide to be friends and then proceed to follow them over the course of the next two decades.We see them through assorted relationships, phone calls, fights, hopes, vacations, missed opportunities, laughter and tears. There is always the anticipation of, will these two ever get together? The tone of the movie is different than the book, trying to be a bit like 'When Harry Met Sally' and failing. I also didn't ever feel the connection between Dexter and Em. I guess I should stop comparing the two, apples and oranges and all that but when you adore a book as much as I did its hard.The ageing of the characters is very well done here, subtle but especially apparent at the very end when the movie flips back to the night they met and you go wow, look how young they were. The clothing is also true to the decade and there are some fun (bad) hairstyles. 1/4/15","3","1 April 2015"
"neil-476","I give advance notice that I am going to be spoilering fairly extensively as this review goes on: you have been warned. Spoiler-free synopsis: Emma and Dexter meet on the day they graduate from university (July 15th 1988): there is an instant connection, and they nearly do the deed, but not quite. Instead, they enter into a long-term friendship which we, the audience, look in on every year on the anniversary of their meeting. Without giving anything away at this point, Emma becomes a waitress and would-be author who takes up with an unsuccessful stand-up comedian, and Dexter becomes a promiscuous TV presenter. We can see that that, ideally, they should be together because Emma desperately loves Dexter, and would be able to turn him from the louche, dissolute rake he has become into the decent man he has the potential to be. But, as the years go by, they always shy away from it. Anne Hathaway plays Emma and Jim Sturgess plays Dexter.Let me comment on a couple of points frequently mentioned elsewhere. One, I had no problem with Anne Hathaway's accent. It was, mostly, a tolerable all purpose moderately well-spoken British accent, with occasional ""oop north"" flattened vowels unnecessarily thrown in. It didn't distract me. Two, I understand that the book is a big hit with a chunk of the audience (the cinema audience was mostly older women in pairs, some with husbands dragged along. I was the only solo male). I haven't read the book, so I have no comment as to how well the film represented it.This film irritated me. I recognise that I am not part of the target demographic for a romantic drama, but I can be reached: my tear glands are perfectly prepared to well up in appropriate circumstances. However, I left the cinema dry-eyed and stony-faced: this film did not touch me in the slightest.I think I was irritated with it right from the start. A young man, subsequently shown to be highly promiscuous, ends up in bed with a girl who is ready and willing, and then - nothing happens? No, I don't think so. From then onwards I was constantly aware of the attempted pushing of emotional manipulation buttons, and it just didn't work. I thought the acting was fine, the period atmosphere good despite the odd anachronism, but I couldn't see why these two totally dissimilar people were soulmates, nor why they kept in touch, what she saw in him - in short, nothing about the emotional side of the film worked for me at all.OK, now I'm going to get really spoilery. And then, after donkeys' years go by, and things go pear shaped for him, Dexter finally learns a bit of humility by which time Emma has found herself a French jazz pianist. She instantly dumps the poor pianist and takes up with Dexter. While trying for a baby of their own (he already has a daughter by a previous relationship), she - really, I'm warning you, stop reading now if you don't want to hit a B.I.G. spoiler - is killed in a traffic accident. We then enter the final section of the film which attempts to have its cake and eat it. Intercut with each other we see Dexter coming to terms with life after Emma's death, in touching (but all not that touching!) conversations with his daughter and Emma's old stand-up comedian boyfriend, plus we see a kind of re-set button version of the day Dexter and Emma first got together which leads us towards the more satisfying relationship they could have had/did have (?) For all these years.And that irritated me even more.I was never uninterested in what went on, but I should have been moved by this film, and I wasn't - and I think it is because it was full of emotional dishonesty from start to finish.","3","26 August 2011"
"jmc4769","I just got back home from seeing this movie, and I feel like I've been hit upside the head with a baseball bat. I'm a sucker for romantic movies, and I've sat through hundreds of mediocre ones that were watchable anyway. But One Day had to be one of the worst romance movies I have ever had the misfortune to endure. It was especially disappointing because I've loved Anne Hathaway in just about everything she's been in (Princess Diaries, Ella Enchanted, Rachel Getting Married, The Devil Wears Prada, Rio, etc.). One Day has few redeeming qualities, except for the occasional pretty scenery. The most serious problem is Jim Sturgess's character, Dexter. Dexter is an unlikable, shallow womanizer. I know what you're thinking: Charming womanizers are a staple of these movies. But Sturgess gives Dexter no charm, no glimmer of humanity, no hint that there may be lovable qualities beneath his contemptible persona. The usually wonderful Hathaway (Emma) gets mired down here in a bad script. And there is not the tiniest spark of chemistry between the two. I kept thinking, ""Come on, Emma, block this loser's number and take out a restraining order."" When the inevitable romance comes, it hasn't a shred of believability. This movie ultimately amounts to a plain Jane wish-fulfillment fantasy (yep, Hathaway is supposed to be plain)...sort of like those movies where the nerdy guy gets the hot girl. The plot structure is a big problem too. We see the main characters only on one day (July 15th) of every year from 1988 to 2011. Instead of continuity, character development, and relationship development, we get mostly uninteresting snippets of their lives. The final straw for me though was the surprise ending, which was a completely gratuitous attempt to insert meaningful drama into an otherwise vacuous movie. At this point, I was begging for the movie to be over, but no such luck. Incredibly, screenwriter (and author of the book of the same name), David Nicholls, drags this bad movie out for another 15 minutes or so.","8","19 August 2011"

"achyutaghosh","Disclaimer first up- biased review, as I am a sucker for love stories.I used to think that Hollywood had stopped making emotionally involving love stories. Thank god they made One Day, then. Based on the best selling book by British author Dave Nicholls, the movie explores the intertwined lives of two protagonists of contrasting nature, yet fated to be together. The premise is novel, with the relationship explored though a peek into 15th July of each year, spread over 22 years. Good stories are brought to life by good acting, and here we have two superb exponents in lead roles- Jim Sturgess as Dexter and Anna Hathaway as Emma. Dexter leads the high profile life, a television anchor with success in all forms chasing him, always. But then his life is also hollow, his friends shallow, and in the end, a faces disillusionment and compromise. Emma dwells in obscurity mostly, but through sheer tenacity and belief achieves a modicum of success as a writer. They meet when they are 18, decide to remain lifelong friends, and they do remain so. In the meanwhile meandering through the vagaries of life, they are inexorably drawn towards each other, dependent on each other.Childhood sweethearts, even if long lost, when they do come together, they do get together without any questions asked- i say this having witnessed the same on a close friend of mine. And you cant help but fall in love with Emma and Dexter- their love story is so compelling and adorable, that you become a part of their story, you care for them, you laugh with them, and also cry, you want them to do what you would do, and yes, you desperately want a happy ending for them.And of course there is Anna Hathaway-suitably rumpled and grunge in the first half, and elegance and grace personified in the second, when she flashes her pearly whites, the world seems to be a better place to live.Why do people in love get to be in love in the best of locations? One Day happens in picturesque Edinburgh, colourful London, and stylish Paris. And the best thing that makes it stand out among all love stories is that it is not predictable, till the very end. People and things change with time, but memories remain the same.- here's a movie that raises a toast to happy memories, a Must watch for mushy folks!","9","23 November 2011"
"Philby-3","One Day Two eighties graduates in Edinburgh have an encounter on graduation day, July 15th ; the film follows their relationship by annual updates. Dexter (Jim Sturgess) brilliant, charismatic and a total narcissist and Emma (Ann Hathaway), a demure, warm sort are not a great match and both hitch up with others, but their friendship endures.The film is romantic, but only to a point, and can hardly be described as a comedy; there is too much pain for that, despite some funny dialogue. It is a kind of growing older movie – early promise turning sour, bright young ambitious things tasting failure and settling for something less. The story is cleverly told and nicely shot, with good support from Ken Stott and Patricia Clarkson as Dexter's disapproving parents and Rhys Spall as Emma's husband. Jim Sturgess looks and acts uncannily like a younger Rupert Graves, who has portrayed a long line of charming handsome wastrels. Ann Hathaway might be from New York but she plays Emma perfectly – the dialect coaches really earned their money. Both of the principals manage to evoke our sympathy, though Sturgess has the harder job.July 15 is St Swithin's day. On that day in 1415 the English Army led by Henry V (alias Laurence Olivier or Kenneth Branagh) defeated a larger French force at Agincourt. This has absolutely nothing to do with the movie though Dexter and Emma do at one stage venture to Brittany, where they manage to lose their clothes in one of the film's more comedic moments.I couldn't help feeling the story arc was rather predictable but I was absorbed nonetheless. At the end I'm not sure what the attraction was for Emma – she was smart enough to realise Dexter was a jerk but somehow she couldn't resist. He does get better – perhaps deep down she wanted to reform him. Or perhaps deep down she wanted to be a bit wild too. A film for generation Xers who are wondering what the hell happened to their youthful dreams and plans.","8","14 September 2011"
"napierslogs","""One Day"", based on the novel of the same name, is the relationship of two people, Emma (Anne Hathaway) and Dexter (Jim Sturgess), as we see it on July 15th of each year. As can be expected from the nature of the story, it's a little dry, lacking in comedy. But then again, it's a romantic drama, not a romantic comedy.As is the nature of the two media, movies can never be exactly the same as the novel. But the problem with this one is that they tried to; no story lines were removed. Almost everything was there, just shortened into mostly meaningless segments. I personally could have done with one less event in their lives, and perhaps a different ending, but they tried to be as faithful as possible.What we have here is a movie about a relationship, but the novel was about the people. They traded in character depth and development so we can see them in their more attractive years falling in and out of love.I wasn't very familiar with Jim Sturgess, having seen him play skinny, slightly nerdy, not as confident kids. Dexter is a different breed of guy. Just has high on self-confidence as he is on drugs and alcohol, he gets by on his looks – literally – he's a TV host. Although the different characteristics of Dexter weren't explicitly shown in the movie, Sturgess brought them out in him perfectly. Emma is a more complex character, with significant evolution to who she is throughout the years, except none of that is in the movie, so it just wasn't really possible for Hathaway to portray her as a more interesting person.I would assume that watching ""One Day"" without the benefit of having read the novel would be a fairly confusing, empty experience. With the background that the novel gave me, I could fill in all the missing years and the unexplored layers to the characters, so there was still something to their relationship for me.","1","19 August 2011"
"TheBobbyjames","Very seldom in Hollywood are movies produced that are as emotionally involving as 'One Day.' It's a beautiful, beautiful love story of two people, Emma (Anne Hathaway) and Dex (Jim Sturgess). After spending the night together after graduation, we are taken on a journey into their lives for one day each year after they met; to see where they are or where they're not. Based on the book by David Nicholls (who also wrote the screenplay), 'One Day' transitions from novel to film brilliantly.First let me say film acting is what I believe makes or breaks a movie - if the actors are great, the movie is generally great. That's not to take away from any other element of film at all, but when everything else is done so well, if the acting were bad, the film would have been less memorable. But Anne Hathaway and Jim Sturgess are so very impressive here. They make their characters real and relatable, which are two key things every actor internally wishes they could do. In fact, as an on-screen pair, they work extremely well, together they exude chemistry.What I found most interesting about the entire experience was that I cared so much. I became enamoured with their lives. I kept hoping for the best. I anticipated what would happen to each of them. I sat forward, sat backward. I laughed and I cried. I've said many times before, a great movie will effect you emotionally in more ways than one. You'll be angry, you'll be happy, you'll be sad - the key is that you emote. This movie presented all of those elements. It was fresh and witty and everything you hope a movie will be. It's as beautifully made as it is acted and the locations are exquisite. Far too often, characters in Hollywood seem contrived and are not genuine. 'One Day' is honestly one of the most genuine stories ever told - there is no instant gratification, there is however frustration and that is the beauty of it all. It explores love and love lost, it explores friendship and the constraints of time and distance. It explores each character's journey to happiness and the trials they face along the way. So many little pieces of the puzzle are filled in between the years by simple, single lines of dialogue or actions. It's not the typical script of ""everything's all good-obstacle-everything ends well"" - there's a lot more complexity which makes it realistically genuine.So many little details, like eye-lines, smiles, sighs, cut-off conversations, etc. were paid attention to. The costuming, cinematography and score were spot on and all noteworthy. All of it combined was moving and awe-inspiring. I left the theater crying, but it didn't stop there, even thinking about the movie and those characters is deeply affecting. Maybe there are some underlying themes in the film that I'm identifying with, or maybe, just maybe the actors were really that great. Whatever it is, this film comes with my highest recommendation, is rated PG-13 and runs 107 minutes.","9","31 August 2011"
"TheLittleSongbird","The book was a wonderful read. One Day was a movie I was looking forward to, and while it was disappointing I found it very pleasant.What made the book so good and such a joy to read was not just the emotional impact, modern angst and characterisation but also how nostalgic it made me. The emotional impact and angst is here in the movie, what wasn't quite there was the nostalgia-evidence of it but could've been more- and characterisation which does feel choppy especially with Patricia Clarkson's Alison though Dexter is well realised.That said, I loved the beautiful look of the film, the soundtrack which gave the film its sense of nostalgia and the witty banter between Sturgess and Hathaway. The romantic elements are touching though the comedic elements don't always work coming across as a tad contrived. The direction is decent, the telling of the story is well paced(if somewhat glacial) and faithful and the script has some nice touches but also some weak ones. Of the support performances I thought Rafe Spall, Romola Garai and Ken Stott were the most effective and Clarkson was good if deserving of more to do. The picture belongs to Jim Sturgess, while staying true to his bad boy character of Dexter he also manages to be sympathetic.My feelings on Anne Hathaway were mixed. I loved her radiance and her chemistry with Sturgess, but her accent was inconsistent and felt forced and unnatural whenever she tried it. The shock ending also felt more bewildering than anything else, not the actual tragedy itself but rather the flashbacks that succeeded that I wasn't sure was really needed.In conclusion, pleasant if not entirely successful. 6.5/10 Bethany Cox","8","31 August 2011"
"JimmyCollins","Words cannot describe how wonderful an actress Anne Hathaway is, and in One Day she is in fine form, if there ever was an actress to go down in the history books among the greats it would be her. Jim Sturgess is quite a charming devil swell.The story that takes place in One Day is at moments the anti love story and other times a sweeping epic romance, even though this movie has been adapted from a book it's still a lot more original than other romantic themed films of late. Lone Scherfig definitely suits this style of English romance, starting with An Education and now this, it may sound mean but I just don't think the romantic dramas that come from the U.S have the same genuine feel that the English films do.I had read the book and i have to say that this is a very loyal adaptation, much of the beauty from the book is clear and present here, particularly the friendship aspect between Dex and Emma, in the book it's a quirky kind of friendship and it transferred well on the screen as, I was very pleased that the film makers didn't ruin that with a cheap silly sexual type of friendship.I could say a lot about how lovely this movie is but I think I'll let everyone make up their own mind. A lot of people have a bad opinion of this movie which I find baffling but I suppose each to their own, I just got totally wrapped up in this gorgeous romance.10 out of 10","6","3 September 2011"
"queen_of_naboo88","I went to see One Day last night, and though I had been looking forward to it for a while, I was surprised at how good it actually is. The film has a very unique atmosphere, as it is much quirkier than your average romance. Also, without giving away the ending, I can say that it isn't as predictable as one might think. What I really liked about it was the complexity of the different human relationships that we are shown. The relationship between Emma and Dexter is by no means an easy one, nor is it one-sided. Given how different they are, there is a lot of conflict between them, although they do love each other. Similarly, what Dexter and his ex-wife feel for one another is never pure hatred, but there is a lot of understanding between them. As a consequence, the story seems like it could be taken from real life. Plus, both Hathaway and Sturgess are as convincing as always, which makes this film absolutely worth seeing.","10","19 August 2011"
"guest_pabby","After perusing other reviews for this movie, I believe that many of the ratings are low, not because viewers disliked the movie, but because they disliked the element in which the film shines. The film succeeds in drawing the audience into the friendship between the main characters, played by Jim Sturgess and Anne Hathaway. Both characters find happiness and meaning in parts of their lives, while suffering through other portions without attaining goals they've set for themselves; i.e., this is real life.What the poorly-rating reviewers seek is escapism. In my view--however limited--this film aims to depict two human beings as they learn, grow, and fall in and out of touch with one another. Thus, don't expect any fairy tales here and don't punish the rating on this movie because it isn't a fairy tale! A predictable conclusion to this movie would place Sturgess and Hathaway side by side, married, and living together untouched by the trials of a realistic relationship. Instead, the director effectively and with calculation showcases some of life in the scenes and merely hints at events not shown on the screen. As the film narrates exclusively through one date each year (hence, the name), partial narratives are expected. The final third of the film, shunned by a few reviewers, elevated the creative vision of the story because it introduces the unpredictable nature of real life into a movie that was otherwise a run-of-the-mill romance. Again, speaking in terms of the development between characters, the movie is above average. Speaking in terms of storyline, the first two-thirds, to a certain degree, lack what the final third delivers: surprise! The juxtaposition of the present with the past near the end of this film makes the events even more potent than they would have been. Audience members who do not fall into the ""half-wit"" category can follow the story, regardless of what the viewers who read the novel state in their reviews. Bravo! Lastly, Anne Hathaway is exceedingly lovely.","7","3 September 2011"
"ferguson-6","Greetings again from the darkness. I have not read David Nicholls' novel, but my understanding is that it is extremely well written and its loyal readers really connected with Emma and Dexter. If that's true, then this film version is even worse than I thought while watching.This literally is my least favorite type of movie. A movie that assumes its viewers are unable to think for themselves or judge the actions of its characters. In other words, the filmmakers take for granted that we will accept whatever is shown on the big screen.First let me say that I completely understand the school girl crush that a young Emma (Anne Hathaway) has on her classmate Dexter (Jim Sturgess). He is handsome and charismatic and comes from more money than she. I also understand Dexter's attraction to the lovely Emma. She is very pretty - despite the ridiculous over-sized glasses for the early scenes - and very intelligent, and a significantly nicer person than he.What makes absolutely no sense to me is her continued attraction to this drunken, empty soul for the next twenty years. She is too smart to pine away the years hoping he will wise up and coming running to her. We are supposed to believe that she has no interest in any other relationship other than the non-threatening one with flopping stand-up comedian Ian (played by Timothy Spall's son Rafe) and a ""boring"" French Jazz Pianist.Dexter's mother is played by Patricia Clarkson. As she is dying from cancer, she tells him that she believes he will grow into a good man, but isn't there yet. I guess we are supposed to take her word for it. Instead we only see Dexter go from a selfish pig as a TV personality to a defeated man who must perform manual labor for the first time in his life. My issue is that a defeated man is not necessarily a good man. A man resigned to his life has not necessarily reached enlightenment. Where is Emma's proof that he deserves her? Where is the indication that her life with him will be better? I tell you where ... in the mind of that school girl from years ago.Please don't mistake my words as that of one who has no faith in romantic stories. There are so many ways this story could have turned that it would have had me. Instead it chose a path that assumed I was ignorant ... totally accepting of ridiculous story being laid out for me.My final comments on the film involve the cast. Anne Hathaway is an incredibly talented performer. She is not, however, British. Her accent is terribly distracting. Jim Sturgess is a handsome guy, but just not charismatic enough to pull off the TV personality role. Patricia Clarkson is a fantastic actress, but she is not British either. Seriously, are there not enough British actresses? The casting smells like a money-grubbing production team. As for director Lone Scherfig ... her previous film An Education was cinematic excellence. This is an unacceptable follow-up and we expect better next time.I will say the locations of Edinburg, London and Paris were beautiful and different than we usually get from the movies. That provided the only real enjoyment from this highly disappointing movie.","10","21 August 2011"
"Rob-O-Cop","this had some great aspects to it but ultimately failed to deliver. Firstly the good. Brilliant locations, beautiful cinematography, Anne Hathaway delivers a good performance,The bad. The editor and the director failed to establish a believable connection between the two lead actors as to why they would form a lasting bond that would carry them over 20 years. We're given a hint of this at the end but that doesn't help or fix the rest of the movie, so that's the bad editing aspect of this. if this scene had been at the front it might have helped sell the movie. That that scene didn't really deliver the goods needed to make it believable is the directors mistake along with many of the other scenes that tips the scale against the characters. Too many scenes of Dexter being a jerk and not enough of him being in anyway lovable or charming, even though there was much amusement to be had in the jerk Dexter scenes they blew out the balance of his character and it wasn't till the end that we got to see him as anything less than a jerk, but by then it was too late and it didn't really do anything to alter the confusion of why Emma would have cared. I also didn't buy Jim Sturgess performance, although a lot of people think differently, he came across as a caricature rather than a character. People have criticised Anne Hathaway's accent and there's probably some weight to that but I personally didn't find it annoying once I thought what's going on with her accent as it fluctuated all over the show. That's a continuity and a direction flaw as much as it is her performance. After a few mins I put it in the multi-sourced accent file as many people have blended accents. Outside of that Anne's delivering some really good depth in her work so much so that we may one day forgive her for the princess diaries.","9","27 January 2012"
"francine-k","I had watched ""One Day"" yesterday and was beyond excited because I had read the novel by David Nicholls, which was fantastic. The movie base's around 2 people and their twenty years together, shown only through one day, July 15th. I thought the plot was unique and was a very realistic romance. Sometimes it takes people a lot to lose to realize what life is about, and how certain people are truly important to you. The movie was cute, funny, and quite sad at times. I thought Anne Hathaway did an okay job on the accent, to me it was odd at first but after a couple minutes I had gotten used to it. Her acting was great and you can really see her changing as the years progress. Jim Sturgess was great and in my opinion really portrayed Dexter the best as possible, with the arrogance and attitude exactly as I imagined Dexter would have. In my own opinion the movie was a great watch, was a romance that I had been dying for ever sense The Notebook. Finally a tear jerking but smile at the end movie, that really anyone can enjoy, if your looking for a romance movie.","9","20 August 2011"
"JohnDeSando","One Day is promoted as drama romance and not a rom com. On all three counts I would call it out anyway, for it is a melodramatic, episodic tale of two best friends in London, Emma (Anne Hathaway) and Dexter (Jim Sturgess), who flirt with love over a long period but play on the standard cliché that requires they eventually end up together, regardless how many marriages and children intervene.One Day has too many short episodes from college in the '80's until professional life in 2011, and each seems just a variation on another before it: boy gets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl back again, well, you know the routine. During all these little skirmishes Emma remains wholesome (no stretch for the perpetually cute Hathaway, reminding me of Sally Hawkins' Poppy in Mike Leigh's Happy Go Lucky. But without Hawkins' charisma).Dexter is a cad and Lothario almost all the way, making him unlikeable and difficult to gain our sympathy. His cavalier treatment of his mother (the ever-interesting Patricia Clarkson) and father (Ken Stott) adds to his surly persona. In addition, Sturgess needs a little coaching or better script if he wishes to catch up with the Ryans (Gosling and Reynolds) in the emerging leading-man lineup.Nowhere do I feel a real sexual heat, especially since in most of the film they are avowing to be just friends. Moreover in the numerous years/episodes I do not feel the intellectual and emotional connection that comes so naturally in Richard Linklater's Before Sunrise/Sunset series. Even director Lone Scherfig's Parisian scenes are vacant, poor cousins to Woody Allen's romantic City of Lights in Midnight in Paris.As an Anglophile, I usually can forgive many sins if a film gives me an adequate dose of the great city, but as with the Paris background, romance takes a holiday even from the cities.","4","23 August 2011"
"blanbrn","Over the summer I saw this film sure it's typical chick flick, still as a male I admire the beauty and sexy look of Anne Hathaway who I think is a brilliant actress. Plus I think she pulled the international accent off just fine in this film and as always her look is sharp and just fine. This is a love story that spans time with memories these moments touch you staying with you forever despite when an unexpected tragedy strikes.Set in England it involves a couple Em(Anne Hathaway) and Dexter(Jim Sturgess) and after this international couple graduates from college and meet and fall for one another on July 15, 1989. From every year on on this date it's considered an anniversary for this couple as the film shows the special moments that happened during the lives of both. As each year on the same day is highlighted you see that no matter what path their lives have taken love and memories draw them together.Overall this is a film of memory and everlasting love sadly an unexpected tragedy occurs, but still with memories Dexter will love Em forever as long as memories are around love can last forever. Probably not a great film but worth a watch for any Anne Hathaway fan.","5","10 October 2011"
"jeffallenhammer","Does life imitate art or does art imitate life? I'm one who tends to avoid the discussion entirely by saying ""both."" One Day is the most real (save a few accents) movie I've seen in a long time. It explores time and how it often slips away from us. Our hearts' desires are often decimated by bad timing, and the movie finds a variety of ways to demonstrate this. So in the case of One Day, art imitates life to the fullest, as we can all sympathize (if only a little) to crushed hopes and shattered dreams, though hopefully we eventually find our way.Anne Hathaway stars as insecure working-class woman Emma, who, for one reason or another is drawn to Dexter, (Jim Sturgess) a charming upper middle class man with a great amount of self-confidence. It may be hard to understand just what the two have on each other, but they are characters I'm familiar with. The woman who is way too into a man that's way too into himself, it happens and for the type, Dex is pretty likable. Em and Dex have nothing in common. But their opposite personalities do what a relationship should; make each other better. They are Yin and Yang, complementary opposites.An interesting technique used by One Day, is that we only get to see the events of a single day, July 15, for each of 20 plus years. Some of my peers have taken to calling this a gimmick. In a year where it seems every other film is either a sequel or a remake/reboot, (which critics and public alike have grown tired of) I feel fresh ideas should be applauded, even if it doesn't quite work. For me, however, it worked to perfection. Director Lone Scherfig (An Education) paints the picture of Em and Dex's up and down relationship with great finesse, never having too much happen on the date year to year. The filmmaker fills us in on what has taken place throughout each year, without conversations seeming inorganic. The cinematography is beautiful, especially a scene where our would-be lovers break all their rules by taking a dip at sunset. There's plenty of humor, joy, sadness, regret and a number of other emotions to be felt. I caution viewers that this isn't a romantic comedy, nor does it end like one. One Day is, however, easily one of the most heartfelt films of the year and should be celebrated for its bravery.","9","31 August 2011"
"fernandoschiavi","Based on David Nichols' bestseller, ""One Day"" is a more mature Nicholas Sparks version, but equally tearful and melodramatic. Based on a peculiar and intriguing narrative structure, which revisits the 15th of July in the lives of Dexter and Emma since 1988 over more than 20 years, the story focuses on the maturation of the relationship between its characters, fleeing the punctuality and immediacy that surrounds most novels. Ironically, this same artifice reveals the main weakness of the script - others will be seen in the following paragraphs - because the annual reunion with the characters does not hide the considerable loss of information that motivated sudden changes in the life and behavior of each one.Sensitively directed by the Danish Lone Scherfig (""Education""), who delicately builds the fluid dynamic between Dexter and Emma (Hathaway), One Day is skillful in establishing the passage of time also with the aid of an impeccable make-up job - and notice how Sturgess, in particular, goes from a smooth-faced, jovial boy to a weary middle-aged man with wrinkles and bags under his eyes, while Hathaway emerges chubby (but not exaggeratedly so) after working two years as a waitress in a Mexican restaurant, which is an interesting detail. Benefiting from a competent cast that creates equally complex secondary characters that help compose the journey of the main couple (worth mentioning Rafe Spall, son of Timothy, who transforms the aspiring comedian Ian into a man that is simultaneously pathetic and moving), the film fails here and there by investing in stereotyped characterizations, but still avoiding that they dominate the narrative - and if Dexter's father appears as the typical ""cold and critical father"", Ken Stott manages to make him softer through occasional hesitations that point out his internal effort to try to get closer to the child.Likewise, if Nicholls' dialogues are occasionally forced to appeal to exposition in order to clarify what happened to the characters in the previous year, this is balanced by the good construction of so many other lines (especially those spoken by Hathaway), which they display the cold irony typical of British humor (Emma at one point describes the restaurant where she works as a ""graveyard of ambitions""). As if that were not enough, the script also creates really sensitive interactions between those people, highlighting the brief and beautiful scene between Dexter and his mother, who, played by Patricia Clarkson, shows melancholy and love when telling her son that, even certain that he will be a good man, realizes that he ""isn't there yet"".The dialogues are a strong point of the script, also written by David Nicholls. They are fast, with intelligent insights and manage to perfectly translate the personality of each character and their relationships with each other. Even with silly jokes, like Dexter's mother in Paris saying to her son, ""look over there, Alain Delon"" ... or not, it's your father"", demonstrating how much she is in love with her husband. There are funny scenes too, like when Dexter plays the most famous scene of Spartacus with the dolls for his daughter. But no character is better translated by the dialogues than Emma, the shy girl, but extremely intelligent and sagacious. Each of her lines is a bit of her temperament, feeling, spontaneity.However, it is even in the construction of Dexter and Emma that ""One Day"" proves to be particularly efficient: while the boy quickly achieves professional success, the girl struggles for years trying to make her artistic aspirations viable - a situation that gradually reverses as that we perceive that the former lacks the intellectual, emotional and psychological content that sustains his career, while Emma, growing from suffering, reflection and the simple experience of life, gradually transforms herself into a mature woman and ready to overcome the obstacles that previously prevented it from moving forward (and Sturgess and Hathaway, talented and charismatic, confidently illustrate these changes).The problem is that Hathaway's character quickly becomes the link with the audience. The dreamy sweetness, the sweetness and the detachment transform Emma into a very pleasant company, something that Dexter cannot see. Unsympathetic, self-centered and narcissistic, he uses Emma more as someone to quench the loneliness caused by her personality and assuage her pain and addictions than as a true friendship. Played by the expressionless Sturgess and his characteristic face of suffering, it is practically impossible to believe the beautiful and sensitive Emma fell in love with the guy after a disastrous dinner in which he exposes her (dis)interest. In this way, she emerges as the tragic anchor of the narrative, surrendering herself to the loves of a person she does not love, just to fill the sentimental need. What is revealed in the most cliché of sentences, enunciated according to the Nicholas Sparks booklet: ""she made him decent; you made her happy"".As Emma and Dexter mature, the adolescent, dreamy and inconsequential traits give way to realistic, cynical and disillusioned versions, propelled by tragedies, some of them approached with excessive disregard and disengagement due to the narrative structure - yet another negative effect of this. Elevated to the status of protagonist, an incorrect and questionable decision, Dexter undergoes a wide dramatic arc from his mother's illness (Clarkson), the cancellation of the television program, his marriage to Sylvie (Romola Garai, the young woman from ""Desire and Reparation"" and increasingly better actress), to an event that would definitely humanize him. At times, Emma's life is described in terms of her dream of becoming a writer or her relationship with Ian (Rafe Spall), which is disappointing.By scrutinizing and dissecting fractions of those characters' lives, certain moments should be more appropriately explored in David Nicholls' script. Dexter's firing after a botched interview and being hired on a video game show lacks a glimpse into the character's journey, though we understand what led to this precipitous fall. Similarly, Emma's relationship with Ian, presented at a dinner party without sparks or the guy's inability to make jokes, culminates in the explanation that she can't ""take him watching Wrath of Khan every day anymore"". This excessive exposition becomes constant in the film, requiring that a character needs to contextualize the events that are taking place to the public, which exposes the artificiality of the undertaking; well, if Emma and Dexter are such good friends, it was expected that he would reveal the bad news in the expected time and not months later.On the other hand, the annual narrative is well explored by Danish director Lone Scherfig, and the use of raccords and ellipses in Barney Pilling's montage stands out. And not just temporality, but the duo of characters allows Benoît Delhomme's photography to individualize Emma's trajectory in a nostalgic sepia, while Dexter is bathed in a depressing bluish color palette. Finally, Rachel Portman's score avoids being too intrusive, competently punctuating the narrative. Yes, the idea is curious and the narrative exercise valid (albeit flawed). The trajectory of two people is drawn before our eyes and, let's face it, it's not something usual in novel production. It is a pity, therefore, that the chosen 15th of July sounds hopelessly clichéd and expositional, making the unknown 364 remaining days of each year seem more interesting by comparison.We cannot, however, say that the film is not romantic. It has its moments, even if it prepares us to tears in such an obvious and brief way. Soon we will be in the next year, and the year after that, forgetting the pain and moving on. But that doesn't stop us from living in the moment. They are brief, it is true, but true and well-constructed. Especially in the final act, where we desperately want to go back to the beginning, as an attempt to remake the story, or at least fool our minds with that simple encounter in the middle of the street and a kiss seals the love story that should have been. Director Lone Scherfig managed to bring delicacy to the story of Emma and Dexter, making ""One Day"" a sensitive film. A love story built without resources common to films of this nature. Everything is almost realistic and fearful as life. She regrets that, when the situation picks up, she pulls the rug out from under us, with a cliché situation, announced, made just to make us cry. And she didn't even make it. Still, a good movie of its kind.","7","12 May 2023"
"Likes_Ninjas90","In the late 80s a girl named Emma (Anne Hathaway) is a college student who meets fellow graduate Dexter (Jim Sturgess). They're about to sleep together one evening but decide to remain friends instead. Over the course of twenty years we see how circumstances and other people have kept them divided when they just want to be together. Dexter finds himself hosting a ghastly television show, while being warned by his sick mother (Patricia Clarkson) that he isn't a particularly nice person anymore. He insists that he just wants to have fun, despite being critically panned and moving between women. Emma works her way up from a job in a fast food restaurant, to a teacher and then eventually into a successful author. To the distress of Dexter she has a serious relationship with an obnoxious comedian, which puts her real desires on hold. Late in the timeline, Dexter is married rather unhappily and has a baby girl to look after. An unlikeable leading man makes this one day too many. It's impossible to say what type of movie One Day is. It postures as a comedy but it barely raises a single laugh. And though it also lacks dramatic impact for much of its length too, its one climax is so shocking and over the top that it will leave a sour taste in your mouth. Do not consider this as a date movie. You will not be popular. You also have to wonder late in the movie what the point was. Director Lone Scherfig (An Education, 2009) tries to end things on a very syrupy note. That's very nice for one of the characters but unrewarding for the audience who have waded through twenty years in the lives of these unappealing characters for nothing. The message is ultimately a very obvious, unoriginal and simple one: that life pulls people in opposite directions but happiness can be found in one single moment. Using an extended chronological structure is a gimmick. It allows for little on screen titles to appear in the frame, just like in (500) Days of Summer (2009) but it refuses to enrich character. A film like Blue Valentine (2010) is infinitively more intelligent because it realises that character is structure. It contrasts the past and present day to visualise the changing personalities of its leads and the impact on their relationship. The script by David Nicholls, adapting his own novel, lacks this kind of sophistication. Having the film move through such an extensive period suggests that there will be arching transformations in the characters. But unfortunately Sturgess remains continuously unlikeable all throughout this movie. His character is arrogant, rude, promiscuous and irresponsible. And briefly touching on his fractured relationship with his parents does not make him anymore sympathetic. Patricia Clarkson is barely in this movie because she has so few scenes and I wasn't moved by her appearances as the film intended. One of the golden rules of the romantic comedy is broken here: you don't understand why Emma and Dexter belong together. This is a detriment to the film's plotting and the motives of the characters. We're left wondering what this apparently sophisticated woman continues to see in this buffoon, especially when she's already with better company. Even after that huge climax Dexter still has a moment of madness. Only at the very end does he wake up to himself. The actors aren't really to blame. Anne Hathaway is such a pleasant actress in almost everything she does, comedy or otherwise. But this sketchy, underwritten role wastes her talents and doesn't stretch her chops at all. She's made to look dorky and uptight with her over-sized glasses, only to move into little but quirkiness. And Jim Sturgess who I liked in Across the Universe (2007) and The Way Back (2010) is gifted too, with no shortage of personality. He just happens to be playing a real jerk. If that's what he intended, he certainly succeeded. As far as the rebirth of frank romantic-comedies goes this is a pretty uninspired and limp entry.","8","24 August 2011"
"ianlouisiana","Here in the UK we call people like this ""Up themselves""and I can't think of a film where that description of the characters is more applicable.
One frankly poisonous bloke with his brains in his pants tries for 20 - odd years to seduce a girl he was at university with.
That,basically,is what ""One Day"" is all about.
It's not a love story for heaven sake,he is pathologically incapable of feeling so complex an emotion.
Except towards himself.
She wastes a significant proportion of her life waiting for him to change into a completely different person then,quite inexplicably decides she'll take him on as he is.Maybe she is hearing her biological clock.ticking.
Whatever,she dumps her French jazz pianist boyfriend so quickly he hardly has time to learn the melodic minor scale.
The device on which ""One Day"" hangs is so flimsy I lost interest very early on.
It might have been more winning if the writer had made the ""One Day"" the 29th February - at least it would have been over sooner.
All you need to know about the characters is that they play the terribly posh game ""Are you there,Moriarty"",an Oxbridge version of Blind Man's Buff with added violence .
Under the guise of which the seriously unpleasant guy smacks his girlfriend very hard in the face with a rolled up newspaper,causing her nose to bleed.
She(the lovely Romelai Garai - by far the best performance)still marries him and has his baby.
Well,I never said they were clever.","7","25 February 2018"
"chaz-28","There is a lingering and persistent distraction throughout One Day which severely impairs the audience from becoming absorbed in the film. This is Anne Hathaway's atrocious accent. Many Americans have at varying degrees in the past successfully pulled off a believable British accent. However, Anne Hathaway's character, Emma Morley, sounds at different times Irish, Scottish, and American, but never British. It truly was irritating after awhile. Why didn't the filmmakers just cast a British actress? Or, if they were dead set on Hathaway playing Emma, then move the whole story to America. If not for the distracting aural miscues, this film would most likely be much more enjoyable.Emma and Dexter (Jim Sturgess) meet the night of college graduation at the tail end of an all night party. This is not a meet-cute either. They are the only two left as the last couple pairs off with each other; therefore, fate has thrown them together to have a one night stand. Things get in the way and they end up deciding to be friends and start a very long platonic relationship. This is mostly convincing as Emma is seen to be truly infatuated with Dexter who does not see her in the same light, in fact, he treats her rather poorly as the years go by. Graduation night was July 15th by the way so naturally the pair concocts a plan to meet up annually on that day or at least check in my telephone if this is not possible.Surprisingly, every July 15th is actually a pretty horrible, sad day for each of them. Very rarely is one or both of them in a good mood and happy with where their life is at when the film jumps forward to another July 15th. Furthermore, the film focuses much more on Dexter than Emma with extensive scenes concerning his alcoholism and career missteps. Emma even authors a successful book and it hardly gets a mention until Dexter happens upon it. This made me wonder that if Dexter was to have so much more attention and screen time than Emma, why all the fuss to make Anne Hathaway British? Since the screenplay was written by the same gentlemen who wrote the novel this film is based on, the story's climax is inevitable even though it is forced and manipulative. The scene is also very poorly shot. The director, Lone Scherfig, who made the brilliant An Education two years ago, completely misses the mark with this scene and the rest of the film suffers for it. The event is set up in a way that even people who venture out and see one movie a year will be able to see what is coming up.Another miscue is Patricia Clarkson's role as Dexter's mother. It feels her role has been severely cut during the editing process. Not only does she have dialogue in the preview which is not in the movie, but she only shows up in about two-three scenes, moves the plot along, and then she's out of there. I have not read the novel, but I guarantee she is a much larger presence on those pages than what seems to be a faint echo of her in this movie.P.S. There is an atrocious Elvis Costello song over the closing credits which destroys any lingering fondness or afterthoughts the audience may have been enjoying during the closing scenes.","4","24 August 2011"
"Ali_John_Catterall","Yes, entirely predictably (well, you probably guessed as much from the trailer), they made an utter pig's ear of it. The Good:As Dex, Jim Sturgess is decent - nails the look, and the accent (both of them). Rafe Spall, as hapless wannabe comedian Ian is also fine - although there isn't a scintilla of genuine anguish about him when he's dumped, but hey, it's not his story right? (To be honest, it's a wonder they didn't simply represent him with a balloon on a stick.)It does have a few reflective moments of stillness, which are incredibly welcome - mostly concerning Dex and family (if the book was arguably slanted more towards Emma's side of the story, here it favours Dex) - but they're all too rare.The Bad:All too rare, because this one zips along like it's left the iron on (no mean feat in an 108 minute movie), galloping toward the denouement so that any emotional investment we might have made in it is almost completely wiped out. 1997, for example, literally lasts a swimming pool length. I know book-to-film adaptations bowdlerise to an extent, but this is absolutely ridiculous. There's also an argument to be made about the wisdom of letting writers adapt their own screenplays. Perhaps some sense of objectivity is lost in the process. Oddly enough, a previous David Nicholls' TV mini-series called 'I Saw You', starring Fay Ripley, is practically a warm-up for One Day, and is absolutely wonderful - very worth tracking down. That was in three parts. If the makers of One Day hadn't been so concerned with making a quick buck (usual story), this would have benefited from a mini-series of its own. But then, of course, there's no money in Telly.At its worst, the film's truncation manifests in a reliance on phone calls between the pair, which makes it seem as if Sturgess is frankly *stalking* Anne Hathaway. *That* twist, at least, is intact, and somewhat shocking. But in the same way a sudden glimpse of a mink being flayed alive in the middle of a Disney cartoon might be.Couldn't they have found one single British actress for crying out loud? Yes, I know only too well about the need for overseas investment. But you're not looking at Anne Hathaway thinking, 'working-class Northener' you're distractedly thinking, 'Isn't that... Anne Hathaway, working in a Tex Mex restaurant in Camden?'Romola Garai, who plays Sophie, would have done better - dressed-down a bit. (Or as often suggested, Carey Mulligan.) And how do they pull off Hathaway being only subtly attractive? Oversize specs. Because, you know, specs always make people look *dowdy*, apparently. I'm not even going to talk about her accent. You've heard it. It ranges from Angela's Ashes to... well, to Hathaway's own American accent, in fact.The Ugly:The more I think about this, the crosser I get. Film Emma never has any tawdry affairs, as in the novel, as it wouldn't suit her martyred character - and it wouldn't suit the fragrant Hathaway. A layered, interesting character becomes a 2-dimensional pouter; pure and nun-like. Just waiting around for Dexter to be ready, waiting for him to finally come around, and save her tormented soul. It's repulsive, actually - and *totally* a betrayal of her character and the spirit of the original. In short, it's not the very worst film in the world - it's just completely and utterly unremarkable; Sub-Richard Curtis, which is something this lovely and moving book just isn't.","3","19 August 2011"
"sdebord3136","I was pleasantly surprised by this film. I thought this was going to be another chick flick with a guy flirting with a girl but I found it was an amazing love story that spans 2 decades and gives a glimpse of what true love could really be. Anne H. was great for this because she is a timeless beauty that played her role through the years wonderfully, and Jim S. did a great job evolving with his character through immaturity to understanding. The European setting was beautiful and added to the scenes from the city to country side building the romance of it all.I wish I would have seen it sooner :)","3","20 November 2011"
"axxmy_one","People keep saying that movie adaptations from novels are usually not the same. Some are bad, some are okay, but in this case, it was beautiful. Lots of credit goes to David Nicholls for his excellent screenplay. Everything was PERFECT. Timeline, storyline and even the small details was well written. The acting was impeccable too. What about Anne Hathaway's accent? No problems there. Jim Sturgess plays the character Dexter perfectly. Most people would say that The Notebook is the top romantic teary eyed film. I tell them this: One Day is way better. It shows that two people can have friendship, loyalty, affection and love continuously. Watch it. Whether you have read the book or not, you will fall in love with Dexter & Emma !","8","24 November 2011"
"juneebuggy","I was a huge fan of the book by David Nicholls and really looked foreword to seeing this... And while it didn't quite live up to my expectations and somewhat failed to capture the love and tragedy of the novel it was still a decent enough romance.The lovely Jim Sturgess plays rich playboy Dexter, with the (mostly irritating) Anne Hathaway as working class woman Em. We join them in 1988 on the night of their college graduation where they almost get together, decide to be friends and then proceed to follow them over the course of the next two decades.We see them through assorted relationships, phone calls, fights, hopes, vacations, missed opportunities, laughter and tears. There is always the anticipation of, will these two ever get together? The tone of the movie is different than the book, trying to be a bit like 'When Harry Met Sally' and failing. I also didn't ever feel the connection between Dexter and Em. I guess I should stop comparing the two, apples and oranges and all that but when you adore a book as much as I did its hard.The ageing of the characters is very well done here, subtle but especially apparent at the very end when the movie flips back to the night they met and you go wow, look how young they were. The clothing is also true to the decade and there are some fun (bad) hairstyles. 1/4/15","10","1 April 2015"
"neil-476","I give advance notice that I am going to be spoilering fairly extensively as this review goes on: you have been warned. Spoiler-free synopsis: Emma and Dexter meet on the day they graduate from university (July 15th 1988): there is an instant connection, and they nearly do the deed, but not quite. Instead, they enter into a long-term friendship which we, the audience, look in on every year on the anniversary of their meeting. Without giving anything away at this point, Emma becomes a waitress and would-be author who takes up with an unsuccessful stand-up comedian, and Dexter becomes a promiscuous TV presenter. We can see that that, ideally, they should be together because Emma desperately loves Dexter, and would be able to turn him from the louche, dissolute rake he has become into the decent man he has the potential to be. But, as the years go by, they always shy away from it. Anne Hathaway plays Emma and Jim Sturgess plays Dexter.Let me comment on a couple of points frequently mentioned elsewhere. One, I had no problem with Anne Hathaway's accent. It was, mostly, a tolerable all purpose moderately well-spoken British accent, with occasional ""oop north"" flattened vowels unnecessarily thrown in. It didn't distract me. Two, I understand that the book is a big hit with a chunk of the audience (the cinema audience was mostly older women in pairs, some with husbands dragged along. I was the only solo male). I haven't read the book, so I have no comment as to how well the film represented it.This film irritated me. I recognise that I am not part of the target demographic for a romantic drama, but I can be reached: my tear glands are perfectly prepared to well up in appropriate circumstances. However, I left the cinema dry-eyed and stony-faced: this film did not touch me in the slightest.I think I was irritated with it right from the start. A young man, subsequently shown to be highly promiscuous, ends up in bed with a girl who is ready and willing, and then - nothing happens? No, I don't think so. From then onwards I was constantly aware of the attempted pushing of emotional manipulation buttons, and it just didn't work. I thought the acting was fine, the period atmosphere good despite the odd anachronism, but I couldn't see why these two totally dissimilar people were soulmates, nor why they kept in touch, what she saw in him - in short, nothing about the emotional side of the film worked for me at all.OK, now I'm going to get really spoilery. And then, after donkeys' years go by, and things go pear shaped for him, Dexter finally learns a bit of humility by which time Emma has found herself a French jazz pianist. She instantly dumps the poor pianist and takes up with Dexter. While trying for a baby of their own (he already has a daughter by a previous relationship), she - really, I'm warning you, stop reading now if you don't want to hit a B.I.G. spoiler - is killed in a traffic accident. We then enter the final section of the film which attempts to have its cake and eat it. Intercut with each other we see Dexter coming to terms with life after Emma's death, in touching (but all not that touching!) conversations with his daughter and Emma's old stand-up comedian boyfriend, plus we see a kind of re-set button version of the day Dexter and Emma first got together which leads us towards the more satisfying relationship they could have had/did have (?) For all these years.And that irritated me even more.I was never uninterested in what went on, but I should have been moved by this film, and I wasn't - and I think it is because it was full of emotional dishonesty from start to finish.","9","26 August 2011"
"jmc4769","I just got back home from seeing this movie, and I feel like I've been hit upside the head with a baseball bat. I'm a sucker for romantic movies, and I've sat through hundreds of mediocre ones that were watchable anyway. But One Day had to be one of the worst romance movies I have ever had the misfortune to endure. It was especially disappointing because I've loved Anne Hathaway in just about everything she's been in (Princess Diaries, Ella Enchanted, Rachel Getting Married, The Devil Wears Prada, Rio, etc.). One Day has few redeeming qualities, except for the occasional pretty scenery. The most serious problem is Jim Sturgess's character, Dexter. Dexter is an unlikable, shallow womanizer. I know what you're thinking: Charming womanizers are a staple of these movies. But Sturgess gives Dexter no charm, no glimmer of humanity, no hint that there may be lovable qualities beneath his contemptible persona. The usually wonderful Hathaway (Emma) gets mired down here in a bad script. And there is not the tiniest spark of chemistry between the two. I kept thinking, ""Come on, Emma, block this loser's number and take out a restraining order."" When the inevitable romance comes, it hasn't a shred of believability. This movie ultimately amounts to a plain Jane wish-fulfillment fantasy (yep, Hathaway is supposed to be plain)...sort of like those movies where the nerdy guy gets the hot girl. The plot structure is a big problem too. We see the main characters only on one day (July 15th) of every year from 1988 to 2011. Instead of continuity, character development, and relationship development, we get mostly uninteresting snippets of their lives. The final straw for me though was the surprise ending, which was a completely gratuitous attempt to insert meaningful drama into an otherwise vacuous movie. At this point, I was begging for the movie to be over, but no such luck. Incredibly, screenwriter (and author of the book of the same name), David Nicholls, drags this bad movie out for another 15 minutes or so.","8","19 August 2011"
"851222","Greetings from Lithuania.I don't watch romantic movies often, but when i heard about story of ""One day"" i thought of giving it a chance. And it sure didn't disappoint me. This is a really good love story, told in a single day in a year in period of 23 years. Movie is beautifully filmed, with great acting by the two leads, especially from Anne Hathaway. She's just so ... beautiful in every meaning of this word. Can't wait to see her next summer in ""TDKR"". ""One day"" isn't your typical Hollywood love story and you can clearly FEEL that watching it. Give this movie a chance and you can be really surprised that when this movie will end, you'll fell your self a little ... brighter.","1","16 October 2011"
"achyutaghosh","Disclaimer first up- biased review, as I am a sucker for love stories.I used to think that Hollywood had stopped making emotionally involving love stories. Thank god they made One Day, then. Based on the best selling book by British author Dave Nicholls, the movie explores the intertwined lives of two protagonists of contrasting nature, yet fated to be together. The premise is novel, with the relationship explored though a peek into 15th July of each year, spread over 22 years. Good stories are brought to life by good acting, and here we have two superb exponents in lead roles- Jim Sturgess as Dexter and Anna Hathaway as Emma. Dexter leads the high profile life, a television anchor with success in all forms chasing him, always. But then his life is also hollow, his friends shallow, and in the end, a faces disillusionment and compromise. Emma dwells in obscurity mostly, but through sheer tenacity and belief achieves a modicum of success as a writer. They meet when they are 18, decide to remain lifelong friends, and they do remain so. In the meanwhile meandering through the vagaries of life, they are inexorably drawn towards each other, dependent on each other.Childhood sweethearts, even if long lost, when they do come together, they do get together without any questions asked- i say this having witnessed the same on a close friend of mine. And you cant help but fall in love with Emma and Dexter- their love story is so compelling and adorable, that you become a part of their story, you care for them, you laugh with them, and also cry, you want them to do what you would do, and yes, you desperately want a happy ending for them.And of course there is Anna Hathaway-suitably rumpled and grunge in the first half, and elegance and grace personified in the second, when she flashes her pearly whites, the world seems to be a better place to live.Why do people in love get to be in love in the best of locations? One Day happens in picturesque Edinburgh, colourful London, and stylish Paris. And the best thing that makes it stand out among all love stories is that it is not predictable, till the very end. People and things change with time, but memories remain the same.- here's a movie that raises a toast to happy memories, a Must watch for mushy folks!","9","23 November 2011"
"Philby-3","One Day Two eighties graduates in Edinburgh have an encounter on graduation day, July 15th ; the film follows their relationship by annual updates. Dexter (Jim Sturgess) brilliant, charismatic and a total narcissist and Emma (Ann Hathaway), a demure, warm sort are not a great match and both hitch up with others, but their friendship endures.The film is romantic, but only to a point, and can hardly be described as a comedy; there is too much pain for that, despite some funny dialogue. It is a kind of growing older movie – early promise turning sour, bright young ambitious things tasting failure and settling for something less. The story is cleverly told and nicely shot, with good support from Ken Stott and Patricia Clarkson as Dexter's disapproving parents and Rhys Spall as Emma's husband. Jim Sturgess looks and acts uncannily like a younger Rupert Graves, who has portrayed a long line of charming handsome wastrels. Ann Hathaway might be from New York but she plays Emma perfectly – the dialect coaches really earned their money. Both of the principals manage to evoke our sympathy, though Sturgess has the harder job.July 15 is St Swithin's day. On that day in 1415 the English Army led by Henry V (alias Laurence Olivier or Kenneth Branagh) defeated a larger French force at Agincourt. This has absolutely nothing to do with the movie though Dexter and Emma do at one stage venture to Brittany, where they manage to lose their clothes in one of the film's more comedic moments.I couldn't help feeling the story arc was rather predictable but I was absorbed nonetheless. At the end I'm not sure what the attraction was for Emma – she was smart enough to realise Dexter was a jerk but somehow she couldn't resist. He does get better – perhaps deep down she wanted to reform him. Or perhaps deep down she wanted to be a bit wild too. A film for generation Xers who are wondering what the hell happened to their youthful dreams and plans.","8","14 September 2011"
"napierslogs","""One Day"", based on the novel of the same name, is the relationship of two people, Emma (Anne Hathaway) and Dexter (Jim Sturgess), as we see it on July 15th of each year. As can be expected from the nature of the story, it's a little dry, lacking in comedy. But then again, it's a romantic drama, not a romantic comedy.As is the nature of the two media, movies can never be exactly the same as the novel. But the problem with this one is that they tried to; no story lines were removed. Almost everything was there, just shortened into mostly meaningless segments. I personally could have done with one less event in their lives, and perhaps a different ending, but they tried to be as faithful as possible.What we have here is a movie about a relationship, but the novel was about the people. They traded in character depth and development so we can see them in their more attractive years falling in and out of love.I wasn't very familiar with Jim Sturgess, having seen him play skinny, slightly nerdy, not as confident kids. Dexter is a different breed of guy. Just has high on self-confidence as he is on drugs and alcohol, he gets by on his looks – literally – he's a TV host. Although the different characteristics of Dexter weren't explicitly shown in the movie, Sturgess brought them out in him perfectly. Emma is a more complex character, with significant evolution to who she is throughout the years, except none of that is in the movie, so it just wasn't really possible for Hathaway to portray her as a more interesting person.I would assume that watching ""One Day"" without the benefit of having read the novel would be a fairly confusing, empty experience. With the background that the novel gave me, I could fill in all the missing years and the unexplored layers to the characters, so there was still something to their relationship for me.","6","19 August 2011"
"TheBobbyjames","Very seldom in Hollywood are movies produced that are as emotionally involving as 'One Day.' It's a beautiful, beautiful love story of two people, Emma (Anne Hathaway) and Dex (Jim Sturgess). After spending the night together after graduation, we are taken on a journey into their lives for one day each year after they met; to see where they are or where they're not. Based on the book by David Nicholls (who also wrote the screenplay), 'One Day' transitions from novel to film brilliantly.First let me say film acting is what I believe makes or breaks a movie - if the actors are great, the movie is generally great. That's not to take away from any other element of film at all, but when everything else is done so well, if the acting were bad, the film would have been less memorable. But Anne Hathaway and Jim Sturgess are so very impressive here. They make their characters real and relatable, which are two key things every actor internally wishes they could do. In fact, as an on-screen pair, they work extremely well, together they exude chemistry.What I found most interesting about the entire experience was that I cared so much. I became enamoured with their lives. I kept hoping for the best. I anticipated what would happen to each of them. I sat forward, sat backward. I laughed and I cried. I've said many times before, a great movie will effect you emotionally in more ways than one. You'll be angry, you'll be happy, you'll be sad - the key is that you emote. This movie presented all of those elements. It was fresh and witty and everything you hope a movie will be. It's as beautifully made as it is acted and the locations are exquisite. Far too often, characters in Hollywood seem contrived and are not genuine. 'One Day' is honestly one of the most genuine stories ever told - there is no instant gratification, there is however frustration and that is the beauty of it all. It explores love and love lost, it explores friendship and the constraints of time and distance. It explores each character's journey to happiness and the trials they face along the way. So many little pieces of the puzzle are filled in between the years by simple, single lines of dialogue or actions. It's not the typical script of ""everything's all good-obstacle-everything ends well"" - there's a lot more complexity which makes it realistically genuine.So many little details, like eye-lines, smiles, sighs, cut-off conversations, etc. were paid attention to. The costuming, cinematography and score were spot on and all noteworthy. All of it combined was moving and awe-inspiring. I left the theater crying, but it didn't stop there, even thinking about the movie and those characters is deeply affecting. Maybe there are some underlying themes in the film that I'm identifying with, or maybe, just maybe the actors were really that great. Whatever it is, this film comes with my highest recommendation, is rated PG-13 and runs 107 minutes.","10","31 August 2011"
"TheLittleSongbird","The book was a wonderful read. One Day was a movie I was looking forward to, and while it was disappointing I found it very pleasant.What made the book so good and such a joy to read was not just the emotional impact, modern angst and characterisation but also how nostalgic it made me. The emotional impact and angst is here in the movie, what wasn't quite there was the nostalgia-evidence of it but could've been more- and characterisation which does feel choppy especially with Patricia Clarkson's Alison though Dexter is well realised.That said, I loved the beautiful look of the film, the soundtrack which gave the film its sense of nostalgia and the witty banter between Sturgess and Hathaway. The romantic elements are touching though the comedic elements don't always work coming across as a tad contrived. The direction is decent, the telling of the story is well paced(if somewhat glacial) and faithful and the script has some nice touches but also some weak ones. Of the support performances I thought Rafe Spall, Romola Garai and Ken Stott were the most effective and Clarkson was good if deserving of more to do. The picture belongs to Jim Sturgess, while staying true to his bad boy character of Dexter he also manages to be sympathetic.My feelings on Anne Hathaway were mixed. I loved her radiance and her chemistry with Sturgess, but her accent was inconsistent and felt forced and unnatural whenever she tried it. The shock ending also felt more bewildering than anything else, not the actual tragedy itself but rather the flashbacks that succeeded that I wasn't sure was really needed.In conclusion, pleasant if not entirely successful. 6.5/10 Bethany Cox","7","31 August 2011"
"JimmyCollins","Words cannot describe how wonderful an actress Anne Hathaway is, and in One Day she is in fine form, if there ever was an actress to go down in the history books among the greats it would be her. Jim Sturgess is quite a charming devil swell.The story that takes place in One Day is at moments the anti love story and other times a sweeping epic romance, even though this movie has been adapted from a book it's still a lot more original than other romantic themed films of late. Lone Scherfig definitely suits this style of English romance, starting with An Education and now this, it may sound mean but I just don't think the romantic dramas that come from the U.S have the same genuine feel that the English films do.I had read the book and i have to say that this is a very loyal adaptation, much of the beauty from the book is clear and present here, particularly the friendship aspect between Dex and Emma, in the book it's a quirky kind of friendship and it transferred well on the screen as, I was very pleased that the film makers didn't ruin that with a cheap silly sexual type of friendship.I could say a lot about how lovely this movie is but I think I'll let everyone make up their own mind. A lot of people have a bad opinion of this movie which I find baffling but I suppose each to their own, I just got totally wrapped up in this gorgeous romance.10 out of 10","10","3 September 2011"
"queen_of_naboo88","I went to see One Day last night, and though I had been looking forward to it for a while, I was surprised at how good it actually is. The film has a very unique atmosphere, as it is much quirkier than your average romance. Also, without giving away the ending, I can say that it isn't as predictable as one might think. What I really liked about it was the complexity of the different human relationships that we are shown. The relationship between Emma and Dexter is by no means an easy one, nor is it one-sided. Given how different they are, there is a lot of conflict between them, although they do love each other. Similarly, what Dexter and his ex-wife feel for one another is never pure hatred, but there is a lot of understanding between them. As a consequence, the story seems like it could be taken from real life. Plus, both Hathaway and Sturgess are as convincing as always, which makes this film absolutely worth seeing.","9","19 August 2011"
"guest_pabby","After perusing other reviews for this movie, I believe that many of the ratings are low, not because viewers disliked the movie, but because they disliked the element in which the film shines. The film succeeds in drawing the audience into the friendship between the main characters, played by Jim Sturgess and Anne Hathaway. Both characters find happiness and meaning in parts of their lives, while suffering through other portions without attaining goals they've set for themselves; i.e., this is real life.What the poorly-rating reviewers seek is escapism. In my view--however limited--this film aims to depict two human beings as they learn, grow, and fall in and out of touch with one another. Thus, don't expect any fairy tales here and don't punish the rating on this movie because it isn't a fairy tale! A predictable conclusion to this movie would place Sturgess and Hathaway side by side, married, and living together untouched by the trials of a realistic relationship. Instead, the director effectively and with calculation showcases some of life in the scenes and merely hints at events not shown on the screen. As the film narrates exclusively through one date each year (hence, the name), partial narratives are expected. The final third of the film, shunned by a few reviewers, elevated the creative vision of the story because it introduces the unpredictable nature of real life into a movie that was otherwise a run-of-the-mill romance. Again, speaking in terms of the development between characters, the movie is above average. Speaking in terms of storyline, the first two-thirds, to a certain degree, lack what the final third delivers: surprise! The juxtaposition of the present with the past near the end of this film makes the events even more potent than they would have been. Audience members who do not fall into the ""half-wit"" category can follow the story, regardless of what the viewers who read the novel state in their reviews. Bravo! Lastly, Anne Hathaway is exceedingly lovely.","9","3 September 2011"
"ferguson-6","Greetings again from the darkness. I have not read David Nicholls' novel, but my understanding is that it is extremely well written and its loyal readers really connected with Emma and Dexter. If that's true, then this film version is even worse than I thought while watching.This literally is my least favorite type of movie. A movie that assumes its viewers are unable to think for themselves or judge the actions of its characters. In other words, the filmmakers take for granted that we will accept whatever is shown on the big screen.First let me say that I completely understand the school girl crush that a young Emma (Anne Hathaway) has on her classmate Dexter (Jim Sturgess). He is handsome and charismatic and comes from more money than she. I also understand Dexter's attraction to the lovely Emma. She is very pretty - despite the ridiculous over-sized glasses for the early scenes - and very intelligent, and a significantly nicer person than he.What makes absolutely no sense to me is her continued attraction to this drunken, empty soul for the next twenty years. She is too smart to pine away the years hoping he will wise up and coming running to her. We are supposed to believe that she has no interest in any other relationship other than the non-threatening one with flopping stand-up comedian Ian (played by Timothy Spall's son Rafe) and a ""boring"" French Jazz Pianist.Dexter's mother is played by Patricia Clarkson. As she is dying from cancer, she tells him that she believes he will grow into a good man, but isn't there yet. I guess we are supposed to take her word for it. Instead we only see Dexter go from a selfish pig as a TV personality to a defeated man who must perform manual labor for the first time in his life. My issue is that a defeated man is not necessarily a good man. A man resigned to his life has not necessarily reached enlightenment. Where is Emma's proof that he deserves her? Where is the indication that her life with him will be better? I tell you where ... in the mind of that school girl from years ago.Please don't mistake my words as that of one who has no faith in romantic stories. There are so many ways this story could have turned that it would have had me. Instead it chose a path that assumed I was ignorant ... totally accepting of ridiculous story being laid out for me.My final comments on the film involve the cast. Anne Hathaway is an incredibly talented performer. She is not, however, British. Her accent is terribly distracting. Jim Sturgess is a handsome guy, but just not charismatic enough to pull off the TV personality role. Patricia Clarkson is a fantastic actress, but she is not British either. Seriously, are there not enough British actresses? The casting smells like a money-grubbing production team. As for director Lone Scherfig ... her previous film An Education was cinematic excellence. This is an unacceptable follow-up and we expect better next time.I will say the locations of Edinburg, London and Paris were beautiful and different than we usually get from the movies. That provided the only real enjoyment from this highly disappointing movie.","4","21 August 2011"
"Rob-O-Cop","this had some great aspects to it but ultimately failed to deliver. Firstly the good. Brilliant locations, beautiful cinematography, Anne Hathaway delivers a good performance,The bad. The editor and the director failed to establish a believable connection between the two lead actors as to why they would form a lasting bond that would carry them over 20 years. We're given a hint of this at the end but that doesn't help or fix the rest of the movie, so that's the bad editing aspect of this. if this scene had been at the front it might have helped sell the movie. That that scene didn't really deliver the goods needed to make it believable is the directors mistake along with many of the other scenes that tips the scale against the characters. Too many scenes of Dexter being a jerk and not enough of him being in anyway lovable or charming, even though there was much amusement to be had in the jerk Dexter scenes they blew out the balance of his character and it wasn't till the end that we got to see him as anything less than a jerk, but by then it was too late and it didn't really do anything to alter the confusion of why Emma would have cared. I also didn't buy Jim Sturgess performance, although a lot of people think differently, he came across as a caricature rather than a character. People have criticised Anne Hathaway's accent and there's probably some weight to that but I personally didn't find it annoying once I thought what's going on with her accent as it fluctuated all over the show. That's a continuity and a direction flaw as much as it is her performance. After a few mins I put it in the multi-sourced accent file as many people have blended accents. Outside of that Anne's delivering some really good depth in her work so much so that we may one day forgive her for the princess diaries.","5","27 January 2012"
"francine-k","I had watched ""One Day"" yesterday and was beyond excited because I had read the novel by David Nicholls, which was fantastic. The movie base's around 2 people and their twenty years together, shown only through one day, July 15th. I thought the plot was unique and was a very realistic romance. Sometimes it takes people a lot to lose to realize what life is about, and how certain people are truly important to you. The movie was cute, funny, and quite sad at times. I thought Anne Hathaway did an okay job on the accent, to me it was odd at first but after a couple minutes I had gotten used to it. Her acting was great and you can really see her changing as the years progress. Jim Sturgess was great and in my opinion really portrayed Dexter the best as possible, with the arrogance and attitude exactly as I imagined Dexter would have. In my own opinion the movie was a great watch, was a romance that I had been dying for ever sense The Notebook. Finally a tear jerking but smile at the end movie, that really anyone can enjoy, if your looking for a romance movie.","9","20 August 2011"
"JohnDeSando","One Day is promoted as drama romance and not a rom com. On all three counts I would call it out anyway, for it is a melodramatic, episodic tale of two best friends in London, Emma (Anne Hathaway) and Dexter (Jim Sturgess), who flirt with love over a long period but play on the standard cliché that requires they eventually end up together, regardless how many marriages and children intervene.One Day has too many short episodes from college in the '80's until professional life in 2011, and each seems just a variation on another before it: boy gets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl back again, well, you know the routine. During all these little skirmishes Emma remains wholesome (no stretch for the perpetually cute Hathaway, reminding me of Sally Hawkins' Poppy in Mike Leigh's Happy Go Lucky. But without Hawkins' charisma).Dexter is a cad and Lothario almost all the way, making him unlikeable and difficult to gain our sympathy. His cavalier treatment of his mother (the ever-interesting Patricia Clarkson) and father (Ken Stott) adds to his surly persona. In addition, Sturgess needs a little coaching or better script if he wishes to catch up with the Ryans (Gosling and Reynolds) in the emerging leading-man lineup.Nowhere do I feel a real sexual heat, especially since in most of the film they are avowing to be just friends. Moreover in the numerous years/episodes I do not feel the intellectual and emotional connection that comes so naturally in Richard Linklater's Before Sunrise/Sunset series. Even director Lone Scherfig's Parisian scenes are vacant, poor cousins to Woody Allen's romantic City of Lights in Midnight in Paris.As an Anglophile, I usually can forgive many sins if a film gives me an adequate dose of the great city, but as with the Paris background, romance takes a holiday even from the cities.","7","23 August 2011"
"blanbrn","Over the summer I saw this film sure it's typical chick flick, still as a male I admire the beauty and sexy look of Anne Hathaway who I think is a brilliant actress. Plus I think she pulled the international accent off just fine in this film and as always her look is sharp and just fine. This is a love story that spans time with memories these moments touch you staying with you forever despite when an unexpected tragedy strikes.Set in England it involves a couple Em(Anne Hathaway) and Dexter(Jim Sturgess) and after this international couple graduates from college and meet and fall for one another on July 15, 1989. From every year on on this date it's considered an anniversary for this couple as the film shows the special moments that happened during the lives of both. As each year on the same day is highlighted you see that no matter what path their lives have taken love and memories draw them together.Overall this is a film of memory and everlasting love sadly an unexpected tragedy occurs, but still with memories Dexter will love Em forever as long as memories are around love can last forever. Probably not a great film but worth a watch for any Anne Hathaway fan.","8","10 October 2011"
"jeffallenhammer","Does life imitate art or does art imitate life? I'm one who tends to avoid the discussion entirely by saying ""both."" One Day is the most real (save a few accents) movie I've seen in a long time. It explores time and how it often slips away from us. Our hearts' desires are often decimated by bad timing, and the movie finds a variety of ways to demonstrate this. So in the case of One Day, art imitates life to the fullest, as we can all sympathize (if only a little) to crushed hopes and shattered dreams, though hopefully we eventually find our way.Anne Hathaway stars as insecure working-class woman Emma, who, for one reason or another is drawn to Dexter, (Jim Sturgess) a charming upper middle class man with a great amount of self-confidence. It may be hard to understand just what the two have on each other, but they are characters I'm familiar with. The woman who is way too into a man that's way too into himself, it happens and for the type, Dex is pretty likable. Em and Dex have nothing in common. But their opposite personalities do what a relationship should; make each other better. They are Yin and Yang, complementary opposites.An interesting technique used by One Day, is that we only get to see the events of a single day, July 15, for each of 20 plus years. Some of my peers have taken to calling this a gimmick. In a year where it seems every other film is either a sequel or a remake/reboot, (which critics and public alike have grown tired of) I feel fresh ideas should be applauded, even if it doesn't quite work. For me, however, it worked to perfection. Director Lone Scherfig (An Education) paints the picture of Em and Dex's up and down relationship with great finesse, never having too much happen on the date year to year. The filmmaker fills us in on what has taken place throughout each year, without conversations seeming inorganic. The cinematography is beautiful, especially a scene where our would-be lovers break all their rules by taking a dip at sunset. There's plenty of humor, joy, sadness, regret and a number of other emotions to be felt. I caution viewers that this isn't a romantic comedy, nor does it end like one. One Day is, however, easily one of the most heartfelt films of the year and should be celebrated for its bravery.","7","31 August 2011"
"fernandoschiavi","Based on David Nichols' bestseller, ""One Day"" is a more mature Nicholas Sparks version, but equally tearful and melodramatic. Based on a peculiar and intriguing narrative structure, which revisits the 15th of July in the lives of Dexter and Emma since 1988 over more than 20 years, the story focuses on the maturation of the relationship between its characters, fleeing the punctuality and immediacy that surrounds most novels. Ironically, this same artifice reveals the main weakness of the script - others will be seen in the following paragraphs - because the annual reunion with the characters does not hide the considerable loss of information that motivated sudden changes in the life and behavior of each one.Sensitively directed by the Danish Lone Scherfig (""Education""), who delicately builds the fluid dynamic between Dexter and Emma (Hathaway), One Day is skillful in establishing the passage of time also with the aid of an impeccable make-up job - and notice how Sturgess, in particular, goes from a smooth-faced, jovial boy to a weary middle-aged man with wrinkles and bags under his eyes, while Hathaway emerges chubby (but not exaggeratedly so) after working two years as a waitress in a Mexican restaurant, which is an interesting detail. Benefiting from a competent cast that creates equally complex secondary characters that help compose the journey of the main couple (worth mentioning Rafe Spall, son of Timothy, who transforms the aspiring comedian Ian into a man that is simultaneously pathetic and moving), the film fails here and there by investing in stereotyped characterizations, but still avoiding that they dominate the narrative - and if Dexter's father appears as the typical ""cold and critical father"", Ken Stott manages to make him softer through occasional hesitations that point out his internal effort to try to get closer to the child.Likewise, if Nicholls' dialogues are occasionally forced to appeal to exposition in order to clarify what happened to the characters in the previous year, this is balanced by the good construction of so many other lines (especially those spoken by Hathaway), which they display the cold irony typical of British humor (Emma at one point describes the restaurant where she works as a ""graveyard of ambitions""). As if that were not enough, the script also creates really sensitive interactions between those people, highlighting the brief and beautiful scene between Dexter and his mother, who, played by Patricia Clarkson, shows melancholy and love when telling her son that, even certain that he will be a good man, realizes that he ""isn't there yet"".The dialogues are a strong point of the script, also written by David Nicholls. They are fast, with intelligent insights and manage to perfectly translate the personality of each character and their relationships with each other. Even with silly jokes, like Dexter's mother in Paris saying to her son, ""look over there, Alain Delon"" ... or not, it's your father"", demonstrating how much she is in love with her husband. There are funny scenes too, like when Dexter plays the most famous scene of Spartacus with the dolls for his daughter. But no character is better translated by the dialogues than Emma, the shy girl, but extremely intelligent and sagacious. Each of her lines is a bit of her temperament, feeling, spontaneity.However, it is even in the construction of Dexter and Emma that ""One Day"" proves to be particularly efficient: while the boy quickly achieves professional success, the girl struggles for years trying to make her artistic aspirations viable - a situation that gradually reverses as that we perceive that the former lacks the intellectual, emotional and psychological content that sustains his career, while Emma, growing from suffering, reflection and the simple experience of life, gradually transforms herself into a mature woman and ready to overcome the obstacles that previously prevented it from moving forward (and Sturgess and Hathaway, talented and charismatic, confidently illustrate these changes).The problem is that Hathaway's character quickly becomes the link with the audience. The dreamy sweetness, the sweetness and the detachment transform Emma into a very pleasant company, something that Dexter cannot see. Unsympathetic, self-centered and narcissistic, he uses Emma more as someone to quench the loneliness caused by her personality and assuage her pain and addictions than as a true friendship. Played by the expressionless Sturgess and his characteristic face of suffering, it is practically impossible to believe the beautiful and sensitive Emma fell in love with the guy after a disastrous dinner in which he exposes her (dis)interest. In this way, she emerges as the tragic anchor of the narrative, surrendering herself to the loves of a person she does not love, just to fill the sentimental need. What is revealed in the most cliché of sentences, enunciated according to the Nicholas Sparks booklet: ""she made him decent; you made her happy"".As Emma and Dexter mature, the adolescent, dreamy and inconsequential traits give way to realistic, cynical and disillusioned versions, propelled by tragedies, some of them approached with excessive disregard and disengagement due to the narrative structure - yet another negative effect of this. Elevated to the status of protagonist, an incorrect and questionable decision, Dexter undergoes a wide dramatic arc from his mother's illness (Clarkson), the cancellation of the television program, his marriage to Sylvie (Romola Garai, the young woman from ""Desire and Reparation"" and increasingly better actress), to an event that would definitely humanize him. At times, Emma's life is described in terms of her dream of becoming a writer or her relationship with Ian (Rafe Spall), which is disappointing.By scrutinizing and dissecting fractions of those characters' lives, certain moments should be more appropriately explored in David Nicholls' script. Dexter's firing after a botched interview and being hired on a video game show lacks a glimpse into the character's journey, though we understand what led to this precipitous fall. Similarly, Emma's relationship with Ian, presented at a dinner party without sparks or the guy's inability to make jokes, culminates in the explanation that she can't ""take him watching Wrath of Khan every day anymore"". This excessive exposition becomes constant in the film, requiring that a character needs to contextualize the events that are taking place to the public, which exposes the artificiality of the undertaking; well, if Emma and Dexter are such good friends, it was expected that he would reveal the bad news in the expected time and not months later.On the other hand, the annual narrative is well explored by Danish director Lone Scherfig, and the use of raccords and ellipses in Barney Pilling's montage stands out. And not just temporality, but the duo of characters allows Benoît Delhomme's photography to individualize Emma's trajectory in a nostalgic sepia, while Dexter is bathed in a depressing bluish color palette. Finally, Rachel Portman's score avoids being too intrusive, competently punctuating the narrative. Yes, the idea is curious and the narrative exercise valid (albeit flawed). The trajectory of two people is drawn before our eyes and, let's face it, it's not something usual in novel production. It is a pity, therefore, that the chosen 15th of July sounds hopelessly clichéd and expositional, making the unknown 364 remaining days of each year seem more interesting by comparison.We cannot, however, say that the film is not romantic. It has its moments, even if it prepares us to tears in such an obvious and brief way. Soon we will be in the next year, and the year after that, forgetting the pain and moving on. But that doesn't stop us from living in the moment. They are brief, it is true, but true and well-constructed. Especially in the final act, where we desperately want to go back to the beginning, as an attempt to remake the story, or at least fool our minds with that simple encounter in the middle of the street and a kiss seals the love story that should have been. Director Lone Scherfig managed to bring delicacy to the story of Emma and Dexter, making ""One Day"" a sensitive film. A love story built without resources common to films of this nature. Everything is almost realistic and fearful as life. She regrets that, when the situation picks up, she pulls the rug out from under us, with a cliché situation, announced, made just to make us cry. And she didn't even make it. Still, a good movie of its kind.","4","12 May 2023"
"Likes_Ninjas90","In the late 80s a girl named Emma (Anne Hathaway) is a college student who meets fellow graduate Dexter (Jim Sturgess). They're about to sleep together one evening but decide to remain friends instead. Over the course of twenty years we see how circumstances and other people have kept them divided when they just want to be together. Dexter finds himself hosting a ghastly television show, while being warned by his sick mother (Patricia Clarkson) that he isn't a particularly nice person anymore. He insists that he just wants to have fun, despite being critically panned and moving between women. Emma works her way up from a job in a fast food restaurant, to a teacher and then eventually into a successful author. To the distress of Dexter she has a serious relationship with an obnoxious comedian, which puts her real desires on hold. Late in the timeline, Dexter is married rather unhappily and has a baby girl to look after. An unlikeable leading man makes this one day too many. It's impossible to say what type of movie One Day is. It postures as a comedy but it barely raises a single laugh. And though it also lacks dramatic impact for much of its length too, its one climax is so shocking and over the top that it will leave a sour taste in your mouth. Do not consider this as a date movie. You will not be popular. You also have to wonder late in the movie what the point was. Director Lone Scherfig (An Education, 2009) tries to end things on a very syrupy note. That's very nice for one of the characters but unrewarding for the audience who have waded through twenty years in the lives of these unappealing characters for nothing. The message is ultimately a very obvious, unoriginal and simple one: that life pulls people in opposite directions but happiness can be found in one single moment. Using an extended chronological structure is a gimmick. It allows for little on screen titles to appear in the frame, just like in (500) Days of Summer (2009) but it refuses to enrich character. A film like Blue Valentine (2010) is infinitively more intelligent because it realises that character is structure. It contrasts the past and present day to visualise the changing personalities of its leads and the impact on their relationship. The script by David Nicholls, adapting his own novel, lacks this kind of sophistication. Having the film move through such an extensive period suggests that there will be arching transformations in the characters. But unfortunately Sturgess remains continuously unlikeable all throughout this movie. His character is arrogant, rude, promiscuous and irresponsible. And briefly touching on his fractured relationship with his parents does not make him anymore sympathetic. Patricia Clarkson is barely in this movie because she has so few scenes and I wasn't moved by her appearances as the film intended. One of the golden rules of the romantic comedy is broken here: you don't understand why Emma and Dexter belong together. This is a detriment to the film's plotting and the motives of the characters. We're left wondering what this apparently sophisticated woman continues to see in this buffoon, especially when she's already with better company. Even after that huge climax Dexter still has a moment of madness. Only at the very end does he wake up to himself. The actors aren't really to blame. Anne Hathaway is such a pleasant actress in almost everything she does, comedy or otherwise. But this sketchy, underwritten role wastes her talents and doesn't stretch her chops at all. She's made to look dorky and uptight with her over-sized glasses, only to move into little but quirkiness. And Jim Sturgess who I liked in Across the Universe (2007) and The Way Back (2010) is gifted too, with no shortage of personality. He just happens to be playing a real jerk. If that's what he intended, he certainly succeeded. As far as the rebirth of frank romantic-comedies goes this is a pretty uninspired and limp entry.","3","24 August 2011"
"ianlouisiana","Here in the UK we call people like this ""Up themselves""and I can't think of a film where that description of the characters is more applicable.
One frankly poisonous bloke with his brains in his pants tries for 20 - odd years to seduce a girl he was at university with.
That,basically,is what ""One Day"" is all about.
It's not a love story for heaven sake,he is pathologically incapable of feeling so complex an emotion.
Except towards himself.
She wastes a significant proportion of her life waiting for him to change into a completely different person then,quite inexplicably decides she'll take him on as he is.Maybe she is hearing her biological clock.ticking.
Whatever,she dumps her French jazz pianist boyfriend so quickly he hardly has time to learn the melodic minor scale.
The device on which ""One Day"" hangs is so flimsy I lost interest very early on.
It might have been more winning if the writer had made the ""One Day"" the 29th February - at least it would have been over sooner.
All you need to know about the characters is that they play the terribly posh game ""Are you there,Moriarty"",an Oxbridge version of Blind Man's Buff with added violence .
Under the guise of which the seriously unpleasant guy smacks his girlfriend very hard in the face with a rolled up newspaper,causing her nose to bleed.
She(the lovely Romelai Garai - by far the best performance)still marries him and has his baby.
Well,I never said they were clever.","3","25 February 2018"
"chaz-28","There is a lingering and persistent distraction throughout One Day which severely impairs the audience from becoming absorbed in the film. This is Anne Hathaway's atrocious accent. Many Americans have at varying degrees in the past successfully pulled off a believable British accent. However, Anne Hathaway's character, Emma Morley, sounds at different times Irish, Scottish, and American, but never British. It truly was irritating after awhile. Why didn't the filmmakers just cast a British actress? Or, if they were dead set on Hathaway playing Emma, then move the whole story to America. If not for the distracting aural miscues, this film would most likely be much more enjoyable.Emma and Dexter (Jim Sturgess) meet the night of college graduation at the tail end of an all night party. This is not a meet-cute either. They are the only two left as the last couple pairs off with each other; therefore, fate has thrown them together to have a one night stand. Things get in the way and they end up deciding to be friends and start a very long platonic relationship. This is mostly convincing as Emma is seen to be truly infatuated with Dexter who does not see her in the same light, in fact, he treats her rather poorly as the years go by. Graduation night was July 15th by the way so naturally the pair concocts a plan to meet up annually on that day or at least check in my telephone if this is not possible.Surprisingly, every July 15th is actually a pretty horrible, sad day for each of them. Very rarely is one or both of them in a good mood and happy with where their life is at when the film jumps forward to another July 15th. Furthermore, the film focuses much more on Dexter than Emma with extensive scenes concerning his alcoholism and career missteps. Emma even authors a successful book and it hardly gets a mention until Dexter happens upon it. This made me wonder that if Dexter was to have so much more attention and screen time than Emma, why all the fuss to make Anne Hathaway British? Since the screenplay was written by the same gentlemen who wrote the novel this film is based on, the story's climax is inevitable even though it is forced and manipulative. The scene is also very poorly shot. The director, Lone Scherfig, who made the brilliant An Education two years ago, completely misses the mark with this scene and the rest of the film suffers for it. The event is set up in a way that even people who venture out and see one movie a year will be able to see what is coming up.Another miscue is Patricia Clarkson's role as Dexter's mother. It feels her role has been severely cut during the editing process. Not only does she have dialogue in the preview which is not in the movie, but she only shows up in about two-three scenes, moves the plot along, and then she's out of there. I have not read the novel, but I guarantee she is a much larger presence on those pages than what seems to be a faint echo of her in this movie.P.S. There is an atrocious Elvis Costello song over the closing credits which destroys any lingering fondness or afterthoughts the audience may have been enjoying during the closing scenes.","8","24 August 2011"
"Ali_John_Catterall","Yes, entirely predictably (well, you probably guessed as much from the trailer), they made an utter pig's ear of it. The Good:As Dex, Jim Sturgess is decent - nails the look, and the accent (both of them). Rafe Spall, as hapless wannabe comedian Ian is also fine - although there isn't a scintilla of genuine anguish about him when he's dumped, but hey, it's not his story right? (To be honest, it's a wonder they didn't simply represent him with a balloon on a stick.)It does have a few reflective moments of stillness, which are incredibly welcome - mostly concerning Dex and family (if the book was arguably slanted more towards Emma's side of the story, here it favours Dex) - but they're all too rare.The Bad:All too rare, because this one zips along like it's left the iron on (no mean feat in an 108 minute movie), galloping toward the denouement so that any emotional investment we might have made in it is almost completely wiped out. 1997, for example, literally lasts a swimming pool length. I know book-to-film adaptations bowdlerise to an extent, but this is absolutely ridiculous. There's also an argument to be made about the wisdom of letting writers adapt their own screenplays. Perhaps some sense of objectivity is lost in the process. Oddly enough, a previous David Nicholls' TV mini-series called 'I Saw You', starring Fay Ripley, is practically a warm-up for One Day, and is absolutely wonderful - very worth tracking down. That was in three parts. If the makers of One Day hadn't been so concerned with making a quick buck (usual story), this would have benefited from a mini-series of its own. But then, of course, there's no money in Telly.At its worst, the film's truncation manifests in a reliance on phone calls between the pair, which makes it seem as if Sturgess is frankly *stalking* Anne Hathaway. *That* twist, at least, is intact, and somewhat shocking. But in the same way a sudden glimpse of a mink being flayed alive in the middle of a Disney cartoon might be.Couldn't they have found one single British actress for crying out loud? Yes, I know only too well about the need for overseas investment. But you're not looking at Anne Hathaway thinking, 'working-class Northener' you're distractedly thinking, 'Isn't that... Anne Hathaway, working in a Tex Mex restaurant in Camden?'Romola Garai, who plays Sophie, would have done better - dressed-down a bit. (Or as often suggested, Carey Mulligan.) And how do they pull off Hathaway being only subtly attractive? Oversize specs. Because, you know, specs always make people look *dowdy*, apparently. I'm not even going to talk about her accent. You've heard it. It ranges from Angela's Ashes to... well, to Hathaway's own American accent, in fact.The Ugly:The more I think about this, the crosser I get. Film Emma never has any tawdry affairs, as in the novel, as it wouldn't suit her martyred character - and it wouldn't suit the fragrant Hathaway. A layered, interesting character becomes a 2-dimensional pouter; pure and nun-like. Just waiting around for Dexter to be ready, waiting for him to finally come around, and save her tormented soul. It's repulsive, actually - and *totally* a betrayal of her character and the spirit of the original. In short, it's not the very worst film in the world - it's just completely and utterly unremarkable; Sub-Richard Curtis, which is something this lovely and moving book just isn't.","10","19 August 2011"
"sdebord3136","I was pleasantly surprised by this film. I thought this was going to be another chick flick with a guy flirting with a girl but I found it was an amazing love story that spans 2 decades and gives a glimpse of what true love could really be. Anne H. was great for this because she is a timeless beauty that played her role through the years wonderfully, and Jim S. did a great job evolving with his character through immaturity to understanding. The European setting was beautiful and added to the scenes from the city to country side building the romance of it all.I wish I would have seen it sooner :)","9","20 November 2011"
"axxmy_one","People keep saying that movie adaptations from novels are usually not the same. Some are bad, some are okay, but in this case, it was beautiful. Lots of credit goes to David Nicholls for his excellent screenplay. Everything was PERFECT. Timeline, storyline and even the small details was well written. The acting was impeccable too. What about Anne Hathaway's accent? No problems there. Jim Sturgess plays the character Dexter perfectly. Most people would say that The Notebook is the top romantic teary eyed film. I tell them this: One Day is way better. It shows that two people can have friendship, loyalty, affection and love continuously. Watch it. Whether you have read the book or not, you will fall in love with Dexter & Emma !","8","24 November 2011"
"juneebuggy","I was a huge fan of the book by David Nicholls and really looked foreword to seeing this... And while it didn't quite live up to my expectations and somewhat failed to capture the love and tragedy of the novel it was still a decent enough romance.The lovely Jim Sturgess plays rich playboy Dexter, with the (mostly irritating) Anne Hathaway as working class woman Em. We join them in 1988 on the night of their college graduation where they almost get together, decide to be friends and then proceed to follow them over the course of the next two decades.We see them through assorted relationships, phone calls, fights, hopes, vacations, missed opportunities, laughter and tears. There is always the anticipation of, will these two ever get together? The tone of the movie is different than the book, trying to be a bit like 'When Harry Met Sally' and failing. I also didn't ever feel the connection between Dexter and Em. I guess I should stop comparing the two, apples and oranges and all that but when you adore a book as much as I did its hard.The ageing of the characters is very well done here, subtle but especially apparent at the very end when the movie flips back to the night they met and you go wow, look how young they were. The clothing is also true to the decade and there are some fun (bad) hairstyles. 1/4/15","1","1 April 2015"
"neil-476","I give advance notice that I am going to be spoilering fairly extensively as this review goes on: you have been warned. Spoiler-free synopsis: Emma and Dexter meet on the day they graduate from university (July 15th 1988): there is an instant connection, and they nearly do the deed, but not quite. Instead, they enter into a long-term friendship which we, the audience, look in on every year on the anniversary of their meeting. Without giving anything away at this point, Emma becomes a waitress and would-be author who takes up with an unsuccessful stand-up comedian, and Dexter becomes a promiscuous TV presenter. We can see that that, ideally, they should be together because Emma desperately loves Dexter, and would be able to turn him from the louche, dissolute rake he has become into the decent man he has the potential to be. But, as the years go by, they always shy away from it. Anne Hathaway plays Emma and Jim Sturgess plays Dexter.Let me comment on a couple of points frequently mentioned elsewhere. One, I had no problem with Anne Hathaway's accent. It was, mostly, a tolerable all purpose moderately well-spoken British accent, with occasional ""oop north"" flattened vowels unnecessarily thrown in. It didn't distract me. Two, I understand that the book is a big hit with a chunk of the audience (the cinema audience was mostly older women in pairs, some with husbands dragged along. I was the only solo male). I haven't read the book, so I have no comment as to how well the film represented it.This film irritated me. I recognise that I am not part of the target demographic for a romantic drama, but I can be reached: my tear glands are perfectly prepared to well up in appropriate circumstances. However, I left the cinema dry-eyed and stony-faced: this film did not touch me in the slightest.I think I was irritated with it right from the start. A young man, subsequently shown to be highly promiscuous, ends up in bed with a girl who is ready and willing, and then - nothing happens? No, I don't think so. From then onwards I was constantly aware of the attempted pushing of emotional manipulation buttons, and it just didn't work. I thought the acting was fine, the period atmosphere good despite the odd anachronism, but I couldn't see why these two totally dissimilar people were soulmates, nor why they kept in touch, what she saw in him - in short, nothing about the emotional side of the film worked for me at all.OK, now I'm going to get really spoilery. And then, after donkeys' years go by, and things go pear shaped for him, Dexter finally learns a bit of humility by which time Emma has found herself a French jazz pianist. She instantly dumps the poor pianist and takes up with Dexter. While trying for a baby of their own (he already has a daughter by a previous relationship), she - really, I'm warning you, stop reading now if you don't want to hit a B.I.G. spoiler - is killed in a traffic accident. We then enter the final section of the film which attempts to have its cake and eat it. Intercut with each other we see Dexter coming to terms with life after Emma's death, in touching (but all not that touching!) conversations with his daughter and Emma's old stand-up comedian boyfriend, plus we see a kind of re-set button version of the day Dexter and Emma first got together which leads us towards the more satisfying relationship they could have had/did have (?) For all these years.And that irritated me even more.I was never uninterested in what went on, but I should have been moved by this film, and I wasn't - and I think it is because it was full of emotional dishonesty from start to finish.","9","26 August 2011"
"jmc4769","I just got back home from seeing this movie, and I feel like I've been hit upside the head with a baseball bat. I'm a sucker for romantic movies, and I've sat through hundreds of mediocre ones that were watchable anyway. But One Day had to be one of the worst romance movies I have ever had the misfortune to endure. It was especially disappointing because I've loved Anne Hathaway in just about everything she's been in (Princess Diaries, Ella Enchanted, Rachel Getting Married, The Devil Wears Prada, Rio, etc.). One Day has few redeeming qualities, except for the occasional pretty scenery. The most serious problem is Jim Sturgess's character, Dexter. Dexter is an unlikable, shallow womanizer. I know what you're thinking: Charming womanizers are a staple of these movies. But Sturgess gives Dexter no charm, no glimmer of humanity, no hint that there may be lovable qualities beneath his contemptible persona. The usually wonderful Hathaway (Emma) gets mired down here in a bad script. And there is not the tiniest spark of chemistry between the two. I kept thinking, ""Come on, Emma, block this loser's number and take out a restraining order."" When the inevitable romance comes, it hasn't a shred of believability. This movie ultimately amounts to a plain Jane wish-fulfillment fantasy (yep, Hathaway is supposed to be plain)...sort of like those movies where the nerdy guy gets the hot girl. The plot structure is a big problem too. We see the main characters only on one day (July 15th) of every year from 1988 to 2011. Instead of continuity, character development, and relationship development, we get mostly uninteresting snippets of their lives. The final straw for me though was the surprise ending, which was a completely gratuitous attempt to insert meaningful drama into an otherwise vacuous movie. At this point, I was begging for the movie to be over, but no such luck. Incredibly, screenwriter (and author of the book of the same name), David Nicholls, drags this bad movie out for another 15 minutes or so.","8","19 August 2011"

"achyutaghosh","Disclaimer first up- biased review, as I am a sucker for love stories.I used to think that Hollywood had stopped making emotionally involving love stories. Thank god they made One Day, then. Based on the best selling book by British author Dave Nicholls, the movie explores the intertwined lives of two protagonists of contrasting nature, yet fated to be together. The premise is novel, with the relationship explored though a peek into 15th July of each year, spread over 22 years. Good stories are brought to life by good acting, and here we have two superb exponents in lead roles- Jim Sturgess as Dexter and Anna Hathaway as Emma. Dexter leads the high profile life, a television anchor with success in all forms chasing him, always. But then his life is also hollow, his friends shallow, and in the end, a faces disillusionment and compromise. Emma dwells in obscurity mostly, but through sheer tenacity and belief achieves a modicum of success as a writer. They meet when they are 18, decide to remain lifelong friends, and they do remain so. In the meanwhile meandering through the vagaries of life, they are inexorably drawn towards each other, dependent on each other.Childhood sweethearts, even if long lost, when they do come together, they do get together without any questions asked- i say this having witnessed the same on a close friend of mine. And you cant help but fall in love with Emma and Dexter- their love story is so compelling and adorable, that you become a part of their story, you care for them, you laugh with them, and also cry, you want them to do what you would do, and yes, you desperately want a happy ending for them.And of course there is Anna Hathaway-suitably rumpled and grunge in the first half, and elegance and grace personified in the second, when she flashes her pearly whites, the world seems to be a better place to live.Why do people in love get to be in love in the best of locations? One Day happens in picturesque Edinburgh, colourful London, and stylish Paris. And the best thing that makes it stand out among all love stories is that it is not predictable, till the very end. People and things change with time, but memories remain the same.- here's a movie that raises a toast to happy memories, a Must watch for mushy folks!","10","23 November 2011"
"Philby-3","One Day Two eighties graduates in Edinburgh have an encounter on graduation day, July 15th ; the film follows their relationship by annual updates. Dexter (Jim Sturgess) brilliant, charismatic and a total narcissist and Emma (Ann Hathaway), a demure, warm sort are not a great match and both hitch up with others, but their friendship endures.The film is romantic, but only to a point, and can hardly be described as a comedy; there is too much pain for that, despite some funny dialogue. It is a kind of growing older movie – early promise turning sour, bright young ambitious things tasting failure and settling for something less. The story is cleverly told and nicely shot, with good support from Ken Stott and Patricia Clarkson as Dexter's disapproving parents and Rhys Spall as Emma's husband. Jim Sturgess looks and acts uncannily like a younger Rupert Graves, who has portrayed a long line of charming handsome wastrels. Ann Hathaway might be from New York but she plays Emma perfectly – the dialect coaches really earned their money. Both of the principals manage to evoke our sympathy, though Sturgess has the harder job.July 15 is St Swithin's day. On that day in 1415 the English Army led by Henry V (alias Laurence Olivier or Kenneth Branagh) defeated a larger French force at Agincourt. This has absolutely nothing to do with the movie though Dexter and Emma do at one stage venture to Brittany, where they manage to lose their clothes in one of the film's more comedic moments.I couldn't help feeling the story arc was rather predictable but I was absorbed nonetheless. At the end I'm not sure what the attraction was for Emma – she was smart enough to realise Dexter was a jerk but somehow she couldn't resist. He does get better – perhaps deep down she wanted to reform him. Or perhaps deep down she wanted to be a bit wild too. A film for generation Xers who are wondering what the hell happened to their youthful dreams and plans.","7","14 September 2011"
"napierslogs","""One Day"", based on the novel of the same name, is the relationship of two people, Emma (Anne Hathaway) and Dexter (Jim Sturgess), as we see it on July 15th of each year. As can be expected from the nature of the story, it's a little dry, lacking in comedy. But then again, it's a romantic drama, not a romantic comedy.As is the nature of the two media, movies can never be exactly the same as the novel. But the problem with this one is that they tried to; no story lines were removed. Almost everything was there, just shortened into mostly meaningless segments. I personally could have done with one less event in their lives, and perhaps a different ending, but they tried to be as faithful as possible.What we have here is a movie about a relationship, but the novel was about the people. They traded in character depth and development so we can see them in their more attractive years falling in and out of love.I wasn't very familiar with Jim Sturgess, having seen him play skinny, slightly nerdy, not as confident kids. Dexter is a different breed of guy. Just has high on self-confidence as he is on drugs and alcohol, he gets by on his looks – literally – he's a TV host. Although the different characteristics of Dexter weren't explicitly shown in the movie, Sturgess brought them out in him perfectly. Emma is a more complex character, with significant evolution to who she is throughout the years, except none of that is in the movie, so it just wasn't really possible for Hathaway to portray her as a more interesting person.I would assume that watching ""One Day"" without the benefit of having read the novel would be a fairly confusing, empty experience. With the background that the novel gave me, I could fill in all the missing years and the unexplored layers to the characters, so there was still something to their relationship for me.","10","19 August 2011"
"TheBobbyjames","Very seldom in Hollywood are movies produced that are as emotionally involving as 'One Day.' It's a beautiful, beautiful love story of two people, Emma (Anne Hathaway) and Dex (Jim Sturgess). After spending the night together after graduation, we are taken on a journey into their lives for one day each year after they met; to see where they are or where they're not. Based on the book by David Nicholls (who also wrote the screenplay), 'One Day' transitions from novel to film brilliantly.First let me say film acting is what I believe makes or breaks a movie - if the actors are great, the movie is generally great. That's not to take away from any other element of film at all, but when everything else is done so well, if the acting were bad, the film would have been less memorable. But Anne Hathaway and Jim Sturgess are so very impressive here. They make their characters real and relatable, which are two key things every actor internally wishes they could do. In fact, as an on-screen pair, they work extremely well, together they exude chemistry.What I found most interesting about the entire experience was that I cared so much. I became enamoured with their lives. I kept hoping for the best. I anticipated what would happen to each of them. I sat forward, sat backward. I laughed and I cried. I've said many times before, a great movie will effect you emotionally in more ways than one. You'll be angry, you'll be happy, you'll be sad - the key is that you emote. This movie presented all of those elements. It was fresh and witty and everything you hope a movie will be. It's as beautifully made as it is acted and the locations are exquisite. Far too often, characters in Hollywood seem contrived and are not genuine. 'One Day' is honestly one of the most genuine stories ever told - there is no instant gratification, there is however frustration and that is the beauty of it all. It explores love and love lost, it explores friendship and the constraints of time and distance. It explores each character's journey to happiness and the trials they face along the way. So many little pieces of the puzzle are filled in between the years by simple, single lines of dialogue or actions. It's not the typical script of ""everything's all good-obstacle-everything ends well"" - there's a lot more complexity which makes it realistically genuine.So many little details, like eye-lines, smiles, sighs, cut-off conversations, etc. were paid attention to. The costuming, cinematography and score were spot on and all noteworthy. All of it combined was moving and awe-inspiring. I left the theater crying, but it didn't stop there, even thinking about the movie and those characters is deeply affecting. Maybe there are some underlying themes in the film that I'm identifying with, or maybe, just maybe the actors were really that great. Whatever it is, this film comes with my highest recommendation, is rated PG-13 and runs 107 minutes.","9","31 August 2011"
"TheLittleSongbird","The book was a wonderful read. One Day was a movie I was looking forward to, and while it was disappointing I found it very pleasant.What made the book so good and such a joy to read was not just the emotional impact, modern angst and characterisation but also how nostalgic it made me. The emotional impact and angst is here in the movie, what wasn't quite there was the nostalgia-evidence of it but could've been more- and characterisation which does feel choppy especially with Patricia Clarkson's Alison though Dexter is well realised.That said, I loved the beautiful look of the film, the soundtrack which gave the film its sense of nostalgia and the witty banter between Sturgess and Hathaway. The romantic elements are touching though the comedic elements don't always work coming across as a tad contrived. The direction is decent, the telling of the story is well paced(if somewhat glacial) and faithful and the script has some nice touches but also some weak ones. Of the support performances I thought Rafe Spall, Romola Garai and Ken Stott were the most effective and Clarkson was good if deserving of more to do. The picture belongs to Jim Sturgess, while staying true to his bad boy character of Dexter he also manages to be sympathetic.My feelings on Anne Hathaway were mixed. I loved her radiance and her chemistry with Sturgess, but her accent was inconsistent and felt forced and unnatural whenever she tried it. The shock ending also felt more bewildering than anything else, not the actual tragedy itself but rather the flashbacks that succeeded that I wasn't sure was really needed.In conclusion, pleasant if not entirely successful. 6.5/10 Bethany Cox","9","31 August 2011"
"JimmyCollins","Words cannot describe how wonderful an actress Anne Hathaway is, and in One Day she is in fine form, if there ever was an actress to go down in the history books among the greats it would be her. Jim Sturgess is quite a charming devil swell.The story that takes place in One Day is at moments the anti love story and other times a sweeping epic romance, even though this movie has been adapted from a book it's still a lot more original than other romantic themed films of late. Lone Scherfig definitely suits this style of English romance, starting with An Education and now this, it may sound mean but I just don't think the romantic dramas that come from the U.S have the same genuine feel that the English films do.I had read the book and i have to say that this is a very loyal adaptation, much of the beauty from the book is clear and present here, particularly the friendship aspect between Dex and Emma, in the book it's a quirky kind of friendship and it transferred well on the screen as, I was very pleased that the film makers didn't ruin that with a cheap silly sexual type of friendship.I could say a lot about how lovely this movie is but I think I'll let everyone make up their own mind. A lot of people have a bad opinion of this movie which I find baffling but I suppose each to their own, I just got totally wrapped up in this gorgeous romance.10 out of 10","4","3 September 2011"
"queen_of_naboo88","I went to see One Day last night, and though I had been looking forward to it for a while, I was surprised at how good it actually is. The film has a very unique atmosphere, as it is much quirkier than your average romance. Also, without giving away the ending, I can say that it isn't as predictable as one might think. What I really liked about it was the complexity of the different human relationships that we are shown. The relationship between Emma and Dexter is by no means an easy one, nor is it one-sided. Given how different they are, there is a lot of conflict between them, although they do love each other. Similarly, what Dexter and his ex-wife feel for one another is never pure hatred, but there is a lot of understanding between them. As a consequence, the story seems like it could be taken from real life. Plus, both Hathaway and Sturgess are as convincing as always, which makes this film absolutely worth seeing.","5","19 August 2011"
"guest_pabby","After perusing other reviews for this movie, I believe that many of the ratings are low, not because viewers disliked the movie, but because they disliked the element in which the film shines. The film succeeds in drawing the audience into the friendship between the main characters, played by Jim Sturgess and Anne Hathaway. Both characters find happiness and meaning in parts of their lives, while suffering through other portions without attaining goals they've set for themselves; i.e., this is real life.What the poorly-rating reviewers seek is escapism. In my view--however limited--this film aims to depict two human beings as they learn, grow, and fall in and out of touch with one another. Thus, don't expect any fairy tales here and don't punish the rating on this movie because it isn't a fairy tale! A predictable conclusion to this movie would place Sturgess and Hathaway side by side, married, and living together untouched by the trials of a realistic relationship. Instead, the director effectively and with calculation showcases some of life in the scenes and merely hints at events not shown on the screen. As the film narrates exclusively through one date each year (hence, the name), partial narratives are expected. The final third of the film, shunned by a few reviewers, elevated the creative vision of the story because it introduces the unpredictable nature of real life into a movie that was otherwise a run-of-the-mill romance. Again, speaking in terms of the development between characters, the movie is above average. Speaking in terms of storyline, the first two-thirds, to a certain degree, lack what the final third delivers: surprise! The juxtaposition of the present with the past near the end of this film makes the events even more potent than they would have been. Audience members who do not fall into the ""half-wit"" category can follow the story, regardless of what the viewers who read the novel state in their reviews. Bravo! Lastly, Anne Hathaway is exceedingly lovely.","9","3 September 2011"
"ferguson-6","Greetings again from the darkness. I have not read David Nicholls' novel, but my understanding is that it is extremely well written and its loyal readers really connected with Emma and Dexter. If that's true, then this film version is even worse than I thought while watching.This literally is my least favorite type of movie. A movie that assumes its viewers are unable to think for themselves or judge the actions of its characters. In other words, the filmmakers take for granted that we will accept whatever is shown on the big screen.First let me say that I completely understand the school girl crush that a young Emma (Anne Hathaway) has on her classmate Dexter (Jim Sturgess). He is handsome and charismatic and comes from more money than she. I also understand Dexter's attraction to the lovely Emma. She is very pretty - despite the ridiculous over-sized glasses for the early scenes - and very intelligent, and a significantly nicer person than he.What makes absolutely no sense to me is her continued attraction to this drunken, empty soul for the next twenty years. She is too smart to pine away the years hoping he will wise up and coming running to her. We are supposed to believe that she has no interest in any other relationship other than the non-threatening one with flopping stand-up comedian Ian (played by Timothy Spall's son Rafe) and a ""boring"" French Jazz Pianist.Dexter's mother is played by Patricia Clarkson. As she is dying from cancer, she tells him that she believes he will grow into a good man, but isn't there yet. I guess we are supposed to take her word for it. Instead we only see Dexter go from a selfish pig as a TV personality to a defeated man who must perform manual labor for the first time in his life. My issue is that a defeated man is not necessarily a good man. A man resigned to his life has not necessarily reached enlightenment. Where is Emma's proof that he deserves her? Where is the indication that her life with him will be better? I tell you where ... in the mind of that school girl from years ago.Please don't mistake my words as that of one who has no faith in romantic stories. There are so many ways this story could have turned that it would have had me. Instead it chose a path that assumed I was ignorant ... totally accepting of ridiculous story being laid out for me.My final comments on the film involve the cast. Anne Hathaway is an incredibly talented performer. She is not, however, British. Her accent is terribly distracting. Jim Sturgess is a handsome guy, but just not charismatic enough to pull off the TV personality role. Patricia Clarkson is a fantastic actress, but she is not British either. Seriously, are there not enough British actresses? The casting smells like a money-grubbing production team. As for director Lone Scherfig ... her previous film An Education was cinematic excellence. This is an unacceptable follow-up and we expect better next time.I will say the locations of Edinburg, London and Paris were beautiful and different than we usually get from the movies. That provided the only real enjoyment from this highly disappointing movie.","7","21 August 2011"
"Rob-O-Cop","this had some great aspects to it but ultimately failed to deliver. Firstly the good. Brilliant locations, beautiful cinematography, Anne Hathaway delivers a good performance,The bad. The editor and the director failed to establish a believable connection between the two lead actors as to why they would form a lasting bond that would carry them over 20 years. We're given a hint of this at the end but that doesn't help or fix the rest of the movie, so that's the bad editing aspect of this. if this scene had been at the front it might have helped sell the movie. That that scene didn't really deliver the goods needed to make it believable is the directors mistake along with many of the other scenes that tips the scale against the characters. Too many scenes of Dexter being a jerk and not enough of him being in anyway lovable or charming, even though there was much amusement to be had in the jerk Dexter scenes they blew out the balance of his character and it wasn't till the end that we got to see him as anything less than a jerk, but by then it was too late and it didn't really do anything to alter the confusion of why Emma would have cared. I also didn't buy Jim Sturgess performance, although a lot of people think differently, he came across as a caricature rather than a character. People have criticised Anne Hathaway's accent and there's probably some weight to that but I personally didn't find it annoying once I thought what's going on with her accent as it fluctuated all over the show. That's a continuity and a direction flaw as much as it is her performance. After a few mins I put it in the multi-sourced accent file as many people have blended accents. Outside of that Anne's delivering some really good depth in her work so much so that we may one day forgive her for the princess diaries.","8","27 January 2012"
"francine-k","I had watched ""One Day"" yesterday and was beyond excited because I had read the novel by David Nicholls, which was fantastic. The movie base's around 2 people and their twenty years together, shown only through one day, July 15th. I thought the plot was unique and was a very realistic romance. Sometimes it takes people a lot to lose to realize what life is about, and how certain people are truly important to you. The movie was cute, funny, and quite sad at times. I thought Anne Hathaway did an okay job on the accent, to me it was odd at first but after a couple minutes I had gotten used to it. Her acting was great and you can really see her changing as the years progress. Jim Sturgess was great and in my opinion really portrayed Dexter the best as possible, with the arrogance and attitude exactly as I imagined Dexter would have. In my own opinion the movie was a great watch, was a romance that I had been dying for ever sense The Notebook. Finally a tear jerking but smile at the end movie, that really anyone can enjoy, if your looking for a romance movie.","7","20 August 2011"
"JohnDeSando","One Day is promoted as drama romance and not a rom com. On all three counts I would call it out anyway, for it is a melodramatic, episodic tale of two best friends in London, Emma (Anne Hathaway) and Dexter (Jim Sturgess), who flirt with love over a long period but play on the standard cliché that requires they eventually end up together, regardless how many marriages and children intervene.One Day has too many short episodes from college in the '80's until professional life in 2011, and each seems just a variation on another before it: boy gets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl back again, well, you know the routine. During all these little skirmishes Emma remains wholesome (no stretch for the perpetually cute Hathaway, reminding me of Sally Hawkins' Poppy in Mike Leigh's Happy Go Lucky. But without Hawkins' charisma).Dexter is a cad and Lothario almost all the way, making him unlikeable and difficult to gain our sympathy. His cavalier treatment of his mother (the ever-interesting Patricia Clarkson) and father (Ken Stott) adds to his surly persona. In addition, Sturgess needs a little coaching or better script if he wishes to catch up with the Ryans (Gosling and Reynolds) in the emerging leading-man lineup.Nowhere do I feel a real sexual heat, especially since in most of the film they are avowing to be just friends. Moreover in the numerous years/episodes I do not feel the intellectual and emotional connection that comes so naturally in Richard Linklater's Before Sunrise/Sunset series. Even director Lone Scherfig's Parisian scenes are vacant, poor cousins to Woody Allen's romantic City of Lights in Midnight in Paris.As an Anglophile, I usually can forgive many sins if a film gives me an adequate dose of the great city, but as with the Paris background, romance takes a holiday even from the cities.","4","23 August 2011"
"blanbrn","Over the summer I saw this film sure it's typical chick flick, still as a male I admire the beauty and sexy look of Anne Hathaway who I think is a brilliant actress. Plus I think she pulled the international accent off just fine in this film and as always her look is sharp and just fine. This is a love story that spans time with memories these moments touch you staying with you forever despite when an unexpected tragedy strikes.Set in England it involves a couple Em(Anne Hathaway) and Dexter(Jim Sturgess) and after this international couple graduates from college and meet and fall for one another on July 15, 1989. From every year on on this date it's considered an anniversary for this couple as the film shows the special moments that happened during the lives of both. As each year on the same day is highlighted you see that no matter what path their lives have taken love and memories draw them together.Overall this is a film of memory and everlasting love sadly an unexpected tragedy occurs, but still with memories Dexter will love Em forever as long as memories are around love can last forever. Probably not a great film but worth a watch for any Anne Hathaway fan.","3","10 October 2011"
"jeffallenhammer","Does life imitate art or does art imitate life? I'm one who tends to avoid the discussion entirely by saying ""both."" One Day is the most real (save a few accents) movie I've seen in a long time. It explores time and how it often slips away from us. Our hearts' desires are often decimated by bad timing, and the movie finds a variety of ways to demonstrate this. So in the case of One Day, art imitates life to the fullest, as we can all sympathize (if only a little) to crushed hopes and shattered dreams, though hopefully we eventually find our way.Anne Hathaway stars as insecure working-class woman Emma, who, for one reason or another is drawn to Dexter, (Jim Sturgess) a charming upper middle class man with a great amount of self-confidence. It may be hard to understand just what the two have on each other, but they are characters I'm familiar with. The woman who is way too into a man that's way too into himself, it happens and for the type, Dex is pretty likable. Em and Dex have nothing in common. But their opposite personalities do what a relationship should; make each other better. They are Yin and Yang, complementary opposites.An interesting technique used by One Day, is that we only get to see the events of a single day, July 15, for each of 20 plus years. Some of my peers have taken to calling this a gimmick. In a year where it seems every other film is either a sequel or a remake/reboot, (which critics and public alike have grown tired of) I feel fresh ideas should be applauded, even if it doesn't quite work. For me, however, it worked to perfection. Director Lone Scherfig (An Education) paints the picture of Em and Dex's up and down relationship with great finesse, never having too much happen on the date year to year. The filmmaker fills us in on what has taken place throughout each year, without conversations seeming inorganic. The cinematography is beautiful, especially a scene where our would-be lovers break all their rules by taking a dip at sunset. There's plenty of humor, joy, sadness, regret and a number of other emotions to be felt. I caution viewers that this isn't a romantic comedy, nor does it end like one. One Day is, however, easily one of the most heartfelt films of the year and should be celebrated for its bravery.","3","31 August 2011"
"fernandoschiavi","Based on David Nichols' bestseller, ""One Day"" is a more mature Nicholas Sparks version, but equally tearful and melodramatic. Based on a peculiar and intriguing narrative structure, which revisits the 15th of July in the lives of Dexter and Emma since 1988 over more than 20 years, the story focuses on the maturation of the relationship between its characters, fleeing the punctuality and immediacy that surrounds most novels. Ironically, this same artifice reveals the main weakness of the script - others will be seen in the following paragraphs - because the annual reunion with the characters does not hide the considerable loss of information that motivated sudden changes in the life and behavior of each one.Sensitively directed by the Danish Lone Scherfig (""Education""), who delicately builds the fluid dynamic between Dexter and Emma (Hathaway), One Day is skillful in establishing the passage of time also with the aid of an impeccable make-up job - and notice how Sturgess, in particular, goes from a smooth-faced, jovial boy to a weary middle-aged man with wrinkles and bags under his eyes, while Hathaway emerges chubby (but not exaggeratedly so) after working two years as a waitress in a Mexican restaurant, which is an interesting detail. Benefiting from a competent cast that creates equally complex secondary characters that help compose the journey of the main couple (worth mentioning Rafe Spall, son of Timothy, who transforms the aspiring comedian Ian into a man that is simultaneously pathetic and moving), the film fails here and there by investing in stereotyped characterizations, but still avoiding that they dominate the narrative - and if Dexter's father appears as the typical ""cold and critical father"", Ken Stott manages to make him softer through occasional hesitations that point out his internal effort to try to get closer to the child.Likewise, if Nicholls' dialogues are occasionally forced to appeal to exposition in order to clarify what happened to the characters in the previous year, this is balanced by the good construction of so many other lines (especially those spoken by Hathaway), which they display the cold irony typical of British humor (Emma at one point describes the restaurant where she works as a ""graveyard of ambitions""). As if that were not enough, the script also creates really sensitive interactions between those people, highlighting the brief and beautiful scene between Dexter and his mother, who, played by Patricia Clarkson, shows melancholy and love when telling her son that, even certain that he will be a good man, realizes that he ""isn't there yet"".The dialogues are a strong point of the script, also written by David Nicholls. They are fast, with intelligent insights and manage to perfectly translate the personality of each character and their relationships with each other. Even with silly jokes, like Dexter's mother in Paris saying to her son, ""look over there, Alain Delon"" ... or not, it's your father"", demonstrating how much she is in love with her husband. There are funny scenes too, like when Dexter plays the most famous scene of Spartacus with the dolls for his daughter. But no character is better translated by the dialogues than Emma, the shy girl, but extremely intelligent and sagacious. Each of her lines is a bit of her temperament, feeling, spontaneity.However, it is even in the construction of Dexter and Emma that ""One Day"" proves to be particularly efficient: while the boy quickly achieves professional success, the girl struggles for years trying to make her artistic aspirations viable - a situation that gradually reverses as that we perceive that the former lacks the intellectual, emotional and psychological content that sustains his career, while Emma, growing from suffering, reflection and the simple experience of life, gradually transforms herself into a mature woman and ready to overcome the obstacles that previously prevented it from moving forward (and Sturgess and Hathaway, talented and charismatic, confidently illustrate these changes).The problem is that Hathaway's character quickly becomes the link with the audience. The dreamy sweetness, the sweetness and the detachment transform Emma into a very pleasant company, something that Dexter cannot see. Unsympathetic, self-centered and narcissistic, he uses Emma more as someone to quench the loneliness caused by her personality and assuage her pain and addictions than as a true friendship. Played by the expressionless Sturgess and his characteristic face of suffering, it is practically impossible to believe the beautiful and sensitive Emma fell in love with the guy after a disastrous dinner in which he exposes her (dis)interest. In this way, she emerges as the tragic anchor of the narrative, surrendering herself to the loves of a person she does not love, just to fill the sentimental need. What is revealed in the most cliché of sentences, enunciated according to the Nicholas Sparks booklet: ""she made him decent; you made her happy"".As Emma and Dexter mature, the adolescent, dreamy and inconsequential traits give way to realistic, cynical and disillusioned versions, propelled by tragedies, some of them approached with excessive disregard and disengagement due to the narrative structure - yet another negative effect of this. Elevated to the status of protagonist, an incorrect and questionable decision, Dexter undergoes a wide dramatic arc from his mother's illness (Clarkson), the cancellation of the television program, his marriage to Sylvie (Romola Garai, the young woman from ""Desire and Reparation"" and increasingly better actress), to an event that would definitely humanize him. At times, Emma's life is described in terms of her dream of becoming a writer or her relationship with Ian (Rafe Spall), which is disappointing.By scrutinizing and dissecting fractions of those characters' lives, certain moments should be more appropriately explored in David Nicholls' script. Dexter's firing after a botched interview and being hired on a video game show lacks a glimpse into the character's journey, though we understand what led to this precipitous fall. Similarly, Emma's relationship with Ian, presented at a dinner party without sparks or the guy's inability to make jokes, culminates in the explanation that she can't ""take him watching Wrath of Khan every day anymore"". This excessive exposition becomes constant in the film, requiring that a character needs to contextualize the events that are taking place to the public, which exposes the artificiality of the undertaking; well, if Emma and Dexter are such good friends, it was expected that he would reveal the bad news in the expected time and not months later.On the other hand, the annual narrative is well explored by Danish director Lone Scherfig, and the use of raccords and ellipses in Barney Pilling's montage stands out. And not just temporality, but the duo of characters allows Benoît Delhomme's photography to individualize Emma's trajectory in a nostalgic sepia, while Dexter is bathed in a depressing bluish color palette. Finally, Rachel Portman's score avoids being too intrusive, competently punctuating the narrative. Yes, the idea is curious and the narrative exercise valid (albeit flawed). The trajectory of two people is drawn before our eyes and, let's face it, it's not something usual in novel production. It is a pity, therefore, that the chosen 15th of July sounds hopelessly clichéd and expositional, making the unknown 364 remaining days of each year seem more interesting by comparison.We cannot, however, say that the film is not romantic. It has its moments, even if it prepares us to tears in such an obvious and brief way. Soon we will be in the next year, and the year after that, forgetting the pain and moving on. But that doesn't stop us from living in the moment. They are brief, it is true, but true and well-constructed. Especially in the final act, where we desperately want to go back to the beginning, as an attempt to remake the story, or at least fool our minds with that simple encounter in the middle of the street and a kiss seals the love story that should have been. Director Lone Scherfig managed to bring delicacy to the story of Emma and Dexter, making ""One Day"" a sensitive film. A love story built without resources common to films of this nature. Everything is almost realistic and fearful as life. She regrets that, when the situation picks up, she pulls the rug out from under us, with a cliché situation, announced, made just to make us cry. And she didn't even make it. Still, a good movie of its kind.","8","12 May 2023"
"Likes_Ninjas90","In the late 80s a girl named Emma (Anne Hathaway) is a college student who meets fellow graduate Dexter (Jim Sturgess). They're about to sleep together one evening but decide to remain friends instead. Over the course of twenty years we see how circumstances and other people have kept them divided when they just want to be together. Dexter finds himself hosting a ghastly television show, while being warned by his sick mother (Patricia Clarkson) that he isn't a particularly nice person anymore. He insists that he just wants to have fun, despite being critically panned and moving between women. Emma works her way up from a job in a fast food restaurant, to a teacher and then eventually into a successful author. To the distress of Dexter she has a serious relationship with an obnoxious comedian, which puts her real desires on hold. Late in the timeline, Dexter is married rather unhappily and has a baby girl to look after. An unlikeable leading man makes this one day too many. It's impossible to say what type of movie One Day is. It postures as a comedy but it barely raises a single laugh. And though it also lacks dramatic impact for much of its length too, its one climax is so shocking and over the top that it will leave a sour taste in your mouth. Do not consider this as a date movie. You will not be popular. You also have to wonder late in the movie what the point was. Director Lone Scherfig (An Education, 2009) tries to end things on a very syrupy note. That's very nice for one of the characters but unrewarding for the audience who have waded through twenty years in the lives of these unappealing characters for nothing. The message is ultimately a very obvious, unoriginal and simple one: that life pulls people in opposite directions but happiness can be found in one single moment. Using an extended chronological structure is a gimmick. It allows for little on screen titles to appear in the frame, just like in (500) Days of Summer (2009) but it refuses to enrich character. A film like Blue Valentine (2010) is infinitively more intelligent because it realises that character is structure. It contrasts the past and present day to visualise the changing personalities of its leads and the impact on their relationship. The script by David Nicholls, adapting his own novel, lacks this kind of sophistication. Having the film move through such an extensive period suggests that there will be arching transformations in the characters. But unfortunately Sturgess remains continuously unlikeable all throughout this movie. His character is arrogant, rude, promiscuous and irresponsible. And briefly touching on his fractured relationship with his parents does not make him anymore sympathetic. Patricia Clarkson is barely in this movie because she has so few scenes and I wasn't moved by her appearances as the film intended. One of the golden rules of the romantic comedy is broken here: you don't understand why Emma and Dexter belong together. This is a detriment to the film's plotting and the motives of the characters. We're left wondering what this apparently sophisticated woman continues to see in this buffoon, especially when she's already with better company. Even after that huge climax Dexter still has a moment of madness. Only at the very end does he wake up to himself. The actors aren't really to blame. Anne Hathaway is such a pleasant actress in almost everything she does, comedy or otherwise. But this sketchy, underwritten role wastes her talents and doesn't stretch her chops at all. She's made to look dorky and uptight with her over-sized glasses, only to move into little but quirkiness. And Jim Sturgess who I liked in Across the Universe (2007) and The Way Back (2010) is gifted too, with no shortage of personality. He just happens to be playing a real jerk. If that's what he intended, he certainly succeeded. As far as the rebirth of frank romantic-comedies goes this is a pretty uninspired and limp entry.","10","24 August 2011"
"ianlouisiana","Here in the UK we call people like this ""Up themselves""and I can't think of a film where that description of the characters is more applicable.
One frankly poisonous bloke with his brains in his pants tries for 20 - odd years to seduce a girl he was at university with.
That,basically,is what ""One Day"" is all about.
It's not a love story for heaven sake,he is pathologically incapable of feeling so complex an emotion.
Except towards himself.
She wastes a significant proportion of her life waiting for him to change into a completely different person then,quite inexplicably decides she'll take him on as he is.Maybe she is hearing her biological clock.ticking.
Whatever,she dumps her French jazz pianist boyfriend so quickly he hardly has time to learn the melodic minor scale.
The device on which ""One Day"" hangs is so flimsy I lost interest very early on.
It might have been more winning if the writer had made the ""One Day"" the 29th February - at least it would have been over sooner.
All you need to know about the characters is that they play the terribly posh game ""Are you there,Moriarty"",an Oxbridge version of Blind Man's Buff with added violence .
Under the guise of which the seriously unpleasant guy smacks his girlfriend very hard in the face with a rolled up newspaper,causing her nose to bleed.
She(the lovely Romelai Garai - by far the best performance)still marries him and has his baby.
Well,I never said they were clever.","9","25 February 2018"
"chaz-28","There is a lingering and persistent distraction throughout One Day which severely impairs the audience from becoming absorbed in the film. This is Anne Hathaway's atrocious accent. Many Americans have at varying degrees in the past successfully pulled off a believable British accent. However, Anne Hathaway's character, Emma Morley, sounds at different times Irish, Scottish, and American, but never British. It truly was irritating after awhile. Why didn't the filmmakers just cast a British actress? Or, if they were dead set on Hathaway playing Emma, then move the whole story to America. If not for the distracting aural miscues, this film would most likely be much more enjoyable.Emma and Dexter (Jim Sturgess) meet the night of college graduation at the tail end of an all night party. This is not a meet-cute either. They are the only two left as the last couple pairs off with each other; therefore, fate has thrown them together to have a one night stand. Things get in the way and they end up deciding to be friends and start a very long platonic relationship. This is mostly convincing as Emma is seen to be truly infatuated with Dexter who does not see her in the same light, in fact, he treats her rather poorly as the years go by. Graduation night was July 15th by the way so naturally the pair concocts a plan to meet up annually on that day or at least check in my telephone if this is not possible.Surprisingly, every July 15th is actually a pretty horrible, sad day for each of them. Very rarely is one or both of them in a good mood and happy with where their life is at when the film jumps forward to another July 15th. Furthermore, the film focuses much more on Dexter than Emma with extensive scenes concerning his alcoholism and career missteps. Emma even authors a successful book and it hardly gets a mention until Dexter happens upon it. This made me wonder that if Dexter was to have so much more attention and screen time than Emma, why all the fuss to make Anne Hathaway British? Since the screenplay was written by the same gentlemen who wrote the novel this film is based on, the story's climax is inevitable even though it is forced and manipulative. The scene is also very poorly shot. The director, Lone Scherfig, who made the brilliant An Education two years ago, completely misses the mark with this scene and the rest of the film suffers for it. The event is set up in a way that even people who venture out and see one movie a year will be able to see what is coming up.Another miscue is Patricia Clarkson's role as Dexter's mother. It feels her role has been severely cut during the editing process. Not only does she have dialogue in the preview which is not in the movie, but she only shows up in about two-three scenes, moves the plot along, and then she's out of there. I have not read the novel, but I guarantee she is a much larger presence on those pages than what seems to be a faint echo of her in this movie.P.S. There is an atrocious Elvis Costello song over the closing credits which destroys any lingering fondness or afterthoughts the audience may have been enjoying during the closing scenes.","8","24 August 2011"
"Ali_John_Catterall","Yes, entirely predictably (well, you probably guessed as much from the trailer), they made an utter pig's ear of it. The Good:As Dex, Jim Sturgess is decent - nails the look, and the accent (both of them). Rafe Spall, as hapless wannabe comedian Ian is also fine - although there isn't a scintilla of genuine anguish about him when he's dumped, but hey, it's not his story right? (To be honest, it's a wonder they didn't simply represent him with a balloon on a stick.)It does have a few reflective moments of stillness, which are incredibly welcome - mostly concerning Dex and family (if the book was arguably slanted more towards Emma's side of the story, here it favours Dex) - but they're all too rare.The Bad:All too rare, because this one zips along like it's left the iron on (no mean feat in an 108 minute movie), galloping toward the denouement so that any emotional investment we might have made in it is almost completely wiped out. 1997, for example, literally lasts a swimming pool length. I know book-to-film adaptations bowdlerise to an extent, but this is absolutely ridiculous. There's also an argument to be made about the wisdom of letting writers adapt their own screenplays. Perhaps some sense of objectivity is lost in the process. Oddly enough, a previous David Nicholls' TV mini-series called 'I Saw You', starring Fay Ripley, is practically a warm-up for One Day, and is absolutely wonderful - very worth tracking down. That was in three parts. If the makers of One Day hadn't been so concerned with making a quick buck (usual story), this would have benefited from a mini-series of its own. But then, of course, there's no money in Telly.At its worst, the film's truncation manifests in a reliance on phone calls between the pair, which makes it seem as if Sturgess is frankly *stalking* Anne Hathaway. *That* twist, at least, is intact, and somewhat shocking. But in the same way a sudden glimpse of a mink being flayed alive in the middle of a Disney cartoon might be.Couldn't they have found one single British actress for crying out loud? Yes, I know only too well about the need for overseas investment. But you're not looking at Anne Hathaway thinking, 'working-class Northener' you're distractedly thinking, 'Isn't that... Anne Hathaway, working in a Tex Mex restaurant in Camden?'Romola Garai, who plays Sophie, would have done better - dressed-down a bit. (Or as often suggested, Carey Mulligan.) And how do they pull off Hathaway being only subtly attractive? Oversize specs. Because, you know, specs always make people look *dowdy*, apparently. I'm not even going to talk about her accent. You've heard it. It ranges from Angela's Ashes to... well, to Hathaway's own American accent, in fact.The Ugly:The more I think about this, the crosser I get. Film Emma never has any tawdry affairs, as in the novel, as it wouldn't suit her martyred character - and it wouldn't suit the fragrant Hathaway. A layered, interesting character becomes a 2-dimensional pouter; pure and nun-like. Just waiting around for Dexter to be ready, waiting for him to finally come around, and save her tormented soul. It's repulsive, actually - and *totally* a betrayal of her character and the spirit of the original. In short, it's not the very worst film in the world - it's just completely and utterly unremarkable; Sub-Richard Curtis, which is something this lovely and moving book just isn't.","1","19 August 2011"
"sdebord3136","I was pleasantly surprised by this film. I thought this was going to be another chick flick with a guy flirting with a girl but I found it was an amazing love story that spans 2 decades and gives a glimpse of what true love could really be. Anne H. was great for this because she is a timeless beauty that played her role through the years wonderfully, and Jim S. did a great job evolving with his character through immaturity to understanding. The European setting was beautiful and added to the scenes from the city to country side building the romance of it all.I wish I would have seen it sooner :)","9","20 November 2011"
"axxmy_one","People keep saying that movie adaptations from novels are usually not the same. Some are bad, some are okay, but in this case, it was beautiful. Lots of credit goes to David Nicholls for his excellent screenplay. Everything was PERFECT. Timeline, storyline and even the small details was well written. The acting was impeccable too. What about Anne Hathaway's accent? No problems there. Jim Sturgess plays the character Dexter perfectly. Most people would say that The Notebook is the top romantic teary eyed film. I tell them this: One Day is way better. It shows that two people can have friendship, loyalty, affection and love continuously. Watch it. Whether you have read the book or not, you will fall in love with Dexter & Emma !","8","24 November 2011"
"juneebuggy","I was a huge fan of the book by David Nicholls and really looked foreword to seeing this... And while it didn't quite live up to my expectations and somewhat failed to capture the love and tragedy of the novel it was still a decent enough romance.The lovely Jim Sturgess plays rich playboy Dexter, with the (mostly irritating) Anne Hathaway as working class woman Em. We join them in 1988 on the night of their college graduation where they almost get together, decide to be friends and then proceed to follow them over the course of the next two decades.We see them through assorted relationships, phone calls, fights, hopes, vacations, missed opportunities, laughter and tears. There is always the anticipation of, will these two ever get together? The tone of the movie is different than the book, trying to be a bit like 'When Harry Met Sally' and failing. I also didn't ever feel the connection between Dexter and Em. I guess I should stop comparing the two, apples and oranges and all that but when you adore a book as much as I did its hard.The ageing of the characters is very well done here, subtle but especially apparent at the very end when the movie flips back to the night they met and you go wow, look how young they were. The clothing is also true to the decade and there are some fun (bad) hairstyles. 1/4/15","6","1 April 2015"
"neil-476","I give advance notice that I am going to be spoilering fairly extensively as this review goes on: you have been warned. Spoiler-free synopsis: Emma and Dexter meet on the day they graduate from university (July 15th 1988): there is an instant connection, and they nearly do the deed, but not quite. Instead, they enter into a long-term friendship which we, the audience, look in on every year on the anniversary of their meeting. Without giving anything away at this point, Emma becomes a waitress and would-be author who takes up with an unsuccessful stand-up comedian, and Dexter becomes a promiscuous TV presenter. We can see that that, ideally, they should be together because Emma desperately loves Dexter, and would be able to turn him from the louche, dissolute rake he has become into the decent man he has the potential to be. But, as the years go by, they always shy away from it. Anne Hathaway plays Emma and Jim Sturgess plays Dexter.Let me comment on a couple of points frequently mentioned elsewhere. One, I had no problem with Anne Hathaway's accent. It was, mostly, a tolerable all purpose moderately well-spoken British accent, with occasional ""oop north"" flattened vowels unnecessarily thrown in. It didn't distract me. Two, I understand that the book is a big hit with a chunk of the audience (the cinema audience was mostly older women in pairs, some with husbands dragged along. I was the only solo male). I haven't read the book, so I have no comment as to how well the film represented it.This film irritated me. I recognise that I am not part of the target demographic for a romantic drama, but I can be reached: my tear glands are perfectly prepared to well up in appropriate circumstances. However, I left the cinema dry-eyed and stony-faced: this film did not touch me in the slightest.I think I was irritated with it right from the start. A young man, subsequently shown to be highly promiscuous, ends up in bed with a girl who is ready and willing, and then - nothing happens? No, I don't think so. From then onwards I was constantly aware of the attempted pushing of emotional manipulation buttons, and it just didn't work. I thought the acting was fine, the period atmosphere good despite the odd anachronism, but I couldn't see why these two totally dissimilar people were soulmates, nor why they kept in touch, what she saw in him - in short, nothing about the emotional side of the film worked for me at all.OK, now I'm going to get really spoilery. And then, after donkeys' years go by, and things go pear shaped for him, Dexter finally learns a bit of humility by which time Emma has found herself a French jazz pianist. She instantly dumps the poor pianist and takes up with Dexter. While trying for a baby of their own (he already has a daughter by a previous relationship), she - really, I'm warning you, stop reading now if you don't want to hit a B.I.G. spoiler - is killed in a traffic accident. We then enter the final section of the film which attempts to have its cake and eat it. Intercut with each other we see Dexter coming to terms with life after Emma's death, in touching (but all not that touching!) conversations with his daughter and Emma's old stand-up comedian boyfriend, plus we see a kind of re-set button version of the day Dexter and Emma first got together which leads us towards the more satisfying relationship they could have had/did have (?) For all these years.And that irritated me even more.I was never uninterested in what went on, but I should have been moved by this film, and I wasn't - and I think it is because it was full of emotional dishonesty from start to finish.","10","26 August 2011"
"jmc4769","I just got back home from seeing this movie, and I feel like I've been hit upside the head with a baseball bat. I'm a sucker for romantic movies, and I've sat through hundreds of mediocre ones that were watchable anyway. But One Day had to be one of the worst romance movies I have ever had the misfortune to endure. It was especially disappointing because I've loved Anne Hathaway in just about everything she's been in (Princess Diaries, Ella Enchanted, Rachel Getting Married, The Devil Wears Prada, Rio, etc.). One Day has few redeeming qualities, except for the occasional pretty scenery. The most serious problem is Jim Sturgess's character, Dexter. Dexter is an unlikable, shallow womanizer. I know what you're thinking: Charming womanizers are a staple of these movies. But Sturgess gives Dexter no charm, no glimmer of humanity, no hint that there may be lovable qualities beneath his contemptible persona. The usually wonderful Hathaway (Emma) gets mired down here in a bad script. And there is not the tiniest spark of chemistry between the two. I kept thinking, ""Come on, Emma, block this loser's number and take out a restraining order."" When the inevitable romance comes, it hasn't a shred of believability. This movie ultimately amounts to a plain Jane wish-fulfillment fantasy (yep, Hathaway is supposed to be plain)...sort of like those movies where the nerdy guy gets the hot girl. The plot structure is a big problem too. We see the main characters only on one day (July 15th) of every year from 1988 to 2011. Instead of continuity, character development, and relationship development, we get mostly uninteresting snippets of their lives. The final straw for me though was the surprise ending, which was a completely gratuitous attempt to insert meaningful drama into an otherwise vacuous movie. At this point, I was begging for the movie to be over, but no such luck. Incredibly, screenwriter (and author of the book of the same name), David Nicholls, drags this bad movie out for another 15 minutes or so.","7","19 August 2011"

"achyutaghosh","Disclaimer first up- biased review, as I am a sucker for love stories.I used to think that Hollywood had stopped making emotionally involving love stories. Thank god they made One Day, then. Based on the best selling book by British author Dave Nicholls, the movie explores the intertwined lives of two protagonists of contrasting nature, yet fated to be together. The premise is novel, with the relationship explored though a peek into 15th July of each year, spread over 22 years. Good stories are brought to life by good acting, and here we have two superb exponents in lead roles- Jim Sturgess as Dexter and Anna Hathaway as Emma. Dexter leads the high profile life, a television anchor with success in all forms chasing him, always. But then his life is also hollow, his friends shallow, and in the end, a faces disillusionment and compromise. Emma dwells in obscurity mostly, but through sheer tenacity and belief achieves a modicum of success as a writer. They meet when they are 18, decide to remain lifelong friends, and they do remain so. In the meanwhile meandering through the vagaries of life, they are inexorably drawn towards each other, dependent on each other.Childhood sweethearts, even if long lost, when they do come together, they do get together without any questions asked- i say this having witnessed the same on a close friend of mine. And you cant help but fall in love with Emma and Dexter- their love story is so compelling and adorable, that you become a part of their story, you care for them, you laugh with them, and also cry, you want them to do what you would do, and yes, you desperately want a happy ending for them.And of course there is Anna Hathaway-suitably rumpled and grunge in the first half, and elegance and grace personified in the second, when she flashes her pearly whites, the world seems to be a better place to live.Why do people in love get to be in love in the best of locations? One Day happens in picturesque Edinburgh, colourful London, and stylish Paris. And the best thing that makes it stand out among all love stories is that it is not predictable, till the very end. People and things change with time, but memories remain the same.- here's a movie that raises a toast to happy memories, a Must watch for mushy folks!","9","23 November 2011"
"Philby-3","One Day Two eighties graduates in Edinburgh have an encounter on graduation day, July 15th ; the film follows their relationship by annual updates. Dexter (Jim Sturgess) brilliant, charismatic and a total narcissist and Emma (Ann Hathaway), a demure, warm sort are not a great match and both hitch up with others, but their friendship endures.The film is romantic, but only to a point, and can hardly be described as a comedy; there is too much pain for that, despite some funny dialogue. It is a kind of growing older movie – early promise turning sour, bright young ambitious things tasting failure and settling for something less. The story is cleverly told and nicely shot, with good support from Ken Stott and Patricia Clarkson as Dexter's disapproving parents and Rhys Spall as Emma's husband. Jim Sturgess looks and acts uncannily like a younger Rupert Graves, who has portrayed a long line of charming handsome wastrels. Ann Hathaway might be from New York but she plays Emma perfectly – the dialect coaches really earned their money. Both of the principals manage to evoke our sympathy, though Sturgess has the harder job.July 15 is St Swithin's day. On that day in 1415 the English Army led by Henry V (alias Laurence Olivier or Kenneth Branagh) defeated a larger French force at Agincourt. This has absolutely nothing to do with the movie though Dexter and Emma do at one stage venture to Brittany, where they manage to lose their clothes in one of the film's more comedic moments.I couldn't help feeling the story arc was rather predictable but I was absorbed nonetheless. At the end I'm not sure what the attraction was for Emma – she was smart enough to realise Dexter was a jerk but somehow she couldn't resist. He does get better – perhaps deep down she wanted to reform him. Or perhaps deep down she wanted to be a bit wild too. A film for generation Xers who are wondering what the hell happened to their youthful dreams and plans.","9","14 September 2011"
"napierslogs","""One Day"", based on the novel of the same name, is the relationship of two people, Emma (Anne Hathaway) and Dexter (Jim Sturgess), as we see it on July 15th of each year. As can be expected from the nature of the story, it's a little dry, lacking in comedy. But then again, it's a romantic drama, not a romantic comedy.As is the nature of the two media, movies can never be exactly the same as the novel. But the problem with this one is that they tried to; no story lines were removed. Almost everything was there, just shortened into mostly meaningless segments. I personally could have done with one less event in their lives, and perhaps a different ending, but they tried to be as faithful as possible.What we have here is a movie about a relationship, but the novel was about the people. They traded in character depth and development so we can see them in their more attractive years falling in and out of love.I wasn't very familiar with Jim Sturgess, having seen him play skinny, slightly nerdy, not as confident kids. Dexter is a different breed of guy. Just has high on self-confidence as he is on drugs and alcohol, he gets by on his looks – literally – he's a TV host. Although the different characteristics of Dexter weren't explicitly shown in the movie, Sturgess brought them out in him perfectly. Emma is a more complex character, with significant evolution to who she is throughout the years, except none of that is in the movie, so it just wasn't really possible for Hathaway to portray her as a more interesting person.I would assume that watching ""One Day"" without the benefit of having read the novel would be a fairly confusing, empty experience. With the background that the novel gave me, I could fill in all the missing years and the unexplored layers to the characters, so there was still something to their relationship for me.","4","19 August 2011"
"TheBobbyjames","Very seldom in Hollywood are movies produced that are as emotionally involving as 'One Day.' It's a beautiful, beautiful love story of two people, Emma (Anne Hathaway) and Dex (Jim Sturgess). After spending the night together after graduation, we are taken on a journey into their lives for one day each year after they met; to see where they are or where they're not. Based on the book by David Nicholls (who also wrote the screenplay), 'One Day' transitions from novel to film brilliantly.First let me say film acting is what I believe makes or breaks a movie - if the actors are great, the movie is generally great. That's not to take away from any other element of film at all, but when everything else is done so well, if the acting were bad, the film would have been less memorable. But Anne Hathaway and Jim Sturgess are so very impressive here. They make their characters real and relatable, which are two key things every actor internally wishes they could do. In fact, as an on-screen pair, they work extremely well, together they exude chemistry.What I found most interesting about the entire experience was that I cared so much. I became enamoured with their lives. I kept hoping for the best. I anticipated what would happen to each of them. I sat forward, sat backward. I laughed and I cried. I've said many times before, a great movie will effect you emotionally in more ways than one. You'll be angry, you'll be happy, you'll be sad - the key is that you emote. This movie presented all of those elements. It was fresh and witty and everything you hope a movie will be. It's as beautifully made as it is acted and the locations are exquisite. Far too often, characters in Hollywood seem contrived and are not genuine. 'One Day' is honestly one of the most genuine stories ever told - there is no instant gratification, there is however frustration and that is the beauty of it all. It explores love and love lost, it explores friendship and the constraints of time and distance. It explores each character's journey to happiness and the trials they face along the way. So many little pieces of the puzzle are filled in between the years by simple, single lines of dialogue or actions. It's not the typical script of ""everything's all good-obstacle-everything ends well"" - there's a lot more complexity which makes it realistically genuine.So many little details, like eye-lines, smiles, sighs, cut-off conversations, etc. were paid attention to. The costuming, cinematography and score were spot on and all noteworthy. All of it combined was moving and awe-inspiring. I left the theater crying, but it didn't stop there, even thinking about the movie and those characters is deeply affecting. Maybe there are some underlying themes in the film that I'm identifying with, or maybe, just maybe the actors were really that great. Whatever it is, this film comes with my highest recommendation, is rated PG-13 and runs 107 minutes.","5","31 August 2011"
"TheLittleSongbird","The book was a wonderful read. One Day was a movie I was looking forward to, and while it was disappointing I found it very pleasant.What made the book so good and such a joy to read was not just the emotional impact, modern angst and characterisation but also how nostalgic it made me. The emotional impact and angst is here in the movie, what wasn't quite there was the nostalgia-evidence of it but could've been more- and characterisation which does feel choppy especially with Patricia Clarkson's Alison though Dexter is well realised.That said, I loved the beautiful look of the film, the soundtrack which gave the film its sense of nostalgia and the witty banter between Sturgess and Hathaway. The romantic elements are touching though the comedic elements don't always work coming across as a tad contrived. The direction is decent, the telling of the story is well paced(if somewhat glacial) and faithful and the script has some nice touches but also some weak ones. Of the support performances I thought Rafe Spall, Romola Garai and Ken Stott were the most effective and Clarkson was good if deserving of more to do. The picture belongs to Jim Sturgess, while staying true to his bad boy character of Dexter he also manages to be sympathetic.My feelings on Anne Hathaway were mixed. I loved her radiance and her chemistry with Sturgess, but her accent was inconsistent and felt forced and unnatural whenever she tried it. The shock ending also felt more bewildering than anything else, not the actual tragedy itself but rather the flashbacks that succeeded that I wasn't sure was really needed.In conclusion, pleasant if not entirely successful. 6.5/10 Bethany Cox","9","31 August 2011"
"JimmyCollins","Words cannot describe how wonderful an actress Anne Hathaway is, and in One Day she is in fine form, if there ever was an actress to go down in the history books among the greats it would be her. Jim Sturgess is quite a charming devil swell.The story that takes place in One Day is at moments the anti love story and other times a sweeping epic romance, even though this movie has been adapted from a book it's still a lot more original than other romantic themed films of late. Lone Scherfig definitely suits this style of English romance, starting with An Education and now this, it may sound mean but I just don't think the romantic dramas that come from the U.S have the same genuine feel that the English films do.I had read the book and i have to say that this is a very loyal adaptation, much of the beauty from the book is clear and present here, particularly the friendship aspect between Dex and Emma, in the book it's a quirky kind of friendship and it transferred well on the screen as, I was very pleased that the film makers didn't ruin that with a cheap silly sexual type of friendship.I could say a lot about how lovely this movie is but I think I'll let everyone make up their own mind. A lot of people have a bad opinion of this movie which I find baffling but I suppose each to their own, I just got totally wrapped up in this gorgeous romance.10 out of 10","7","3 September 2011"
"queen_of_naboo88","I went to see One Day last night, and though I had been looking forward to it for a while, I was surprised at how good it actually is. The film has a very unique atmosphere, as it is much quirkier than your average romance. Also, without giving away the ending, I can say that it isn't as predictable as one might think. What I really liked about it was the complexity of the different human relationships that we are shown. The relationship between Emma and Dexter is by no means an easy one, nor is it one-sided. Given how different they are, there is a lot of conflict between them, although they do love each other. Similarly, what Dexter and his ex-wife feel for one another is never pure hatred, but there is a lot of understanding between them. As a consequence, the story seems like it could be taken from real life. Plus, both Hathaway and Sturgess are as convincing as always, which makes this film absolutely worth seeing.","8","19 August 2011"
"guest_pabby","After perusing other reviews for this movie, I believe that many of the ratings are low, not because viewers disliked the movie, but because they disliked the element in which the film shines. The film succeeds in drawing the audience into the friendship between the main characters, played by Jim Sturgess and Anne Hathaway. Both characters find happiness and meaning in parts of their lives, while suffering through other portions without attaining goals they've set for themselves; i.e., this is real life.What the poorly-rating reviewers seek is escapism. In my view--however limited--this film aims to depict two human beings as they learn, grow, and fall in and out of touch with one another. Thus, don't expect any fairy tales here and don't punish the rating on this movie because it isn't a fairy tale! A predictable conclusion to this movie would place Sturgess and Hathaway side by side, married, and living together untouched by the trials of a realistic relationship. Instead, the director effectively and with calculation showcases some of life in the scenes and merely hints at events not shown on the screen. As the film narrates exclusively through one date each year (hence, the name), partial narratives are expected. The final third of the film, shunned by a few reviewers, elevated the creative vision of the story because it introduces the unpredictable nature of real life into a movie that was otherwise a run-of-the-mill romance. Again, speaking in terms of the development between characters, the movie is above average. Speaking in terms of storyline, the first two-thirds, to a certain degree, lack what the final third delivers: surprise! The juxtaposition of the present with the past near the end of this film makes the events even more potent than they would have been. Audience members who do not fall into the ""half-wit"" category can follow the story, regardless of what the viewers who read the novel state in their reviews. Bravo! Lastly, Anne Hathaway is exceedingly lovely.","7","3 September 2011"
"ferguson-6","Greetings again from the darkness. I have not read David Nicholls' novel, but my understanding is that it is extremely well written and its loyal readers really connected with Emma and Dexter. If that's true, then this film version is even worse than I thought while watching.This literally is my least favorite type of movie. A movie that assumes its viewers are unable to think for themselves or judge the actions of its characters. In other words, the filmmakers take for granted that we will accept whatever is shown on the big screen.First let me say that I completely understand the school girl crush that a young Emma (Anne Hathaway) has on her classmate Dexter (Jim Sturgess). He is handsome and charismatic and comes from more money than she. I also understand Dexter's attraction to the lovely Emma. She is very pretty - despite the ridiculous over-sized glasses for the early scenes - and very intelligent, and a significantly nicer person than he.What makes absolutely no sense to me is her continued attraction to this drunken, empty soul for the next twenty years. She is too smart to pine away the years hoping he will wise up and coming running to her. We are supposed to believe that she has no interest in any other relationship other than the non-threatening one with flopping stand-up comedian Ian (played by Timothy Spall's son Rafe) and a ""boring"" French Jazz Pianist.Dexter's mother is played by Patricia Clarkson. As she is dying from cancer, she tells him that she believes he will grow into a good man, but isn't there yet. I guess we are supposed to take her word for it. Instead we only see Dexter go from a selfish pig as a TV personality to a defeated man who must perform manual labor for the first time in his life. My issue is that a defeated man is not necessarily a good man. A man resigned to his life has not necessarily reached enlightenment. Where is Emma's proof that he deserves her? Where is the indication that her life with him will be better? I tell you where ... in the mind of that school girl from years ago.Please don't mistake my words as that of one who has no faith in romantic stories. There are so many ways this story could have turned that it would have had me. Instead it chose a path that assumed I was ignorant ... totally accepting of ridiculous story being laid out for me.My final comments on the film involve the cast. Anne Hathaway is an incredibly talented performer. She is not, however, British. Her accent is terribly distracting. Jim Sturgess is a handsome guy, but just not charismatic enough to pull off the TV personality role. Patricia Clarkson is a fantastic actress, but she is not British either. Seriously, are there not enough British actresses? The casting smells like a money-grubbing production team. As for director Lone Scherfig ... her previous film An Education was cinematic excellence. This is an unacceptable follow-up and we expect better next time.I will say the locations of Edinburg, London and Paris were beautiful and different than we usually get from the movies. That provided the only real enjoyment from this highly disappointing movie.","4","21 August 2011"
"Rob-O-Cop","this had some great aspects to it but ultimately failed to deliver. Firstly the good. Brilliant locations, beautiful cinematography, Anne Hathaway delivers a good performance,The bad. The editor and the director failed to establish a believable connection between the two lead actors as to why they would form a lasting bond that would carry them over 20 years. We're given a hint of this at the end but that doesn't help or fix the rest of the movie, so that's the bad editing aspect of this. if this scene had been at the front it might have helped sell the movie. That that scene didn't really deliver the goods needed to make it believable is the directors mistake along with many of the other scenes that tips the scale against the characters. Too many scenes of Dexter being a jerk and not enough of him being in anyway lovable or charming, even though there was much amusement to be had in the jerk Dexter scenes they blew out the balance of his character and it wasn't till the end that we got to see him as anything less than a jerk, but by then it was too late and it didn't really do anything to alter the confusion of why Emma would have cared. I also didn't buy Jim Sturgess performance, although a lot of people think differently, he came across as a caricature rather than a character. People have criticised Anne Hathaway's accent and there's probably some weight to that but I personally didn't find it annoying once I thought what's going on with her accent as it fluctuated all over the show. That's a continuity and a direction flaw as much as it is her performance. After a few mins I put it in the multi-sourced accent file as many people have blended accents. Outside of that Anne's delivering some really good depth in her work so much so that we may one day forgive her for the princess diaries.","3","27 January 2012"
"francine-k","I had watched ""One Day"" yesterday and was beyond excited because I had read the novel by David Nicholls, which was fantastic. The movie base's around 2 people and their twenty years together, shown only through one day, July 15th. I thought the plot was unique and was a very realistic romance. Sometimes it takes people a lot to lose to realize what life is about, and how certain people are truly important to you. The movie was cute, funny, and quite sad at times. I thought Anne Hathaway did an okay job on the accent, to me it was odd at first but after a couple minutes I had gotten used to it. Her acting was great and you can really see her changing as the years progress. Jim Sturgess was great and in my opinion really portrayed Dexter the best as possible, with the arrogance and attitude exactly as I imagined Dexter would have. In my own opinion the movie was a great watch, was a romance that I had been dying for ever sense The Notebook. Finally a tear jerking but smile at the end movie, that really anyone can enjoy, if your looking for a romance movie.","3","20 August 2011"
"JohnDeSando","One Day is promoted as drama romance and not a rom com. On all three counts I would call it out anyway, for it is a melodramatic, episodic tale of two best friends in London, Emma (Anne Hathaway) and Dexter (Jim Sturgess), who flirt with love over a long period but play on the standard cliché that requires they eventually end up together, regardless how many marriages and children intervene.One Day has too many short episodes from college in the '80's until professional life in 2011, and each seems just a variation on another before it: boy gets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl back again, well, you know the routine. During all these little skirmishes Emma remains wholesome (no stretch for the perpetually cute Hathaway, reminding me of Sally Hawkins' Poppy in Mike Leigh's Happy Go Lucky. But without Hawkins' charisma).Dexter is a cad and Lothario almost all the way, making him unlikeable and difficult to gain our sympathy. His cavalier treatment of his mother (the ever-interesting Patricia Clarkson) and father (Ken Stott) adds to his surly persona. In addition, Sturgess needs a little coaching or better script if he wishes to catch up with the Ryans (Gosling and Reynolds) in the emerging leading-man lineup.Nowhere do I feel a real sexual heat, especially since in most of the film they are avowing to be just friends. Moreover in the numerous years/episodes I do not feel the intellectual and emotional connection that comes so naturally in Richard Linklater's Before Sunrise/Sunset series. Even director Lone Scherfig's Parisian scenes are vacant, poor cousins to Woody Allen's romantic City of Lights in Midnight in Paris.As an Anglophile, I usually can forgive many sins if a film gives me an adequate dose of the great city, but as with the Paris background, romance takes a holiday even from the cities.","8","23 August 2011"
"blanbrn","Over the summer I saw this film sure it's typical chick flick, still as a male I admire the beauty and sexy look of Anne Hathaway who I think is a brilliant actress. Plus I think she pulled the international accent off just fine in this film and as always her look is sharp and just fine. This is a love story that spans time with memories these moments touch you staying with you forever despite when an unexpected tragedy strikes.Set in England it involves a couple Em(Anne Hathaway) and Dexter(Jim Sturgess) and after this international couple graduates from college and meet and fall for one another on July 15, 1989. From every year on on this date it's considered an anniversary for this couple as the film shows the special moments that happened during the lives of both. As each year on the same day is highlighted you see that no matter what path their lives have taken love and memories draw them together.Overall this is a film of memory and everlasting love sadly an unexpected tragedy occurs, but still with memories Dexter will love Em forever as long as memories are around love can last forever. Probably not a great film but worth a watch for any Anne Hathaway fan.","10","10 October 2011"
"jeffallenhammer","Does life imitate art or does art imitate life? I'm one who tends to avoid the discussion entirely by saying ""both."" One Day is the most real (save a few accents) movie I've seen in a long time. It explores time and how it often slips away from us. Our hearts' desires are often decimated by bad timing, and the movie finds a variety of ways to demonstrate this. So in the case of One Day, art imitates life to the fullest, as we can all sympathize (if only a little) to crushed hopes and shattered dreams, though hopefully we eventually find our way.Anne Hathaway stars as insecure working-class woman Emma, who, for one reason or another is drawn to Dexter, (Jim Sturgess) a charming upper middle class man with a great amount of self-confidence. It may be hard to understand just what the two have on each other, but they are characters I'm familiar with. The woman who is way too into a man that's way too into himself, it happens and for the type, Dex is pretty likable. Em and Dex have nothing in common. But their opposite personalities do what a relationship should; make each other better. They are Yin and Yang, complementary opposites.An interesting technique used by One Day, is that we only get to see the events of a single day, July 15, for each of 20 plus years. Some of my peers have taken to calling this a gimmick. In a year where it seems every other film is either a sequel or a remake/reboot, (which critics and public alike have grown tired of) I feel fresh ideas should be applauded, even if it doesn't quite work. For me, however, it worked to perfection. Director Lone Scherfig (An Education) paints the picture of Em and Dex's up and down relationship with great finesse, never having too much happen on the date year to year. The filmmaker fills us in on what has taken place throughout each year, without conversations seeming inorganic. The cinematography is beautiful, especially a scene where our would-be lovers break all their rules by taking a dip at sunset. There's plenty of humor, joy, sadness, regret and a number of other emotions to be felt. I caution viewers that this isn't a romantic comedy, nor does it end like one. One Day is, however, easily one of the most heartfelt films of the year and should be celebrated for its bravery.","9","31 August 2011"
"fernandoschiavi","Based on David Nichols' bestseller, ""One Day"" is a more mature Nicholas Sparks version, but equally tearful and melodramatic. Based on a peculiar and intriguing narrative structure, which revisits the 15th of July in the lives of Dexter and Emma since 1988 over more than 20 years, the story focuses on the maturation of the relationship between its characters, fleeing the punctuality and immediacy that surrounds most novels. Ironically, this same artifice reveals the main weakness of the script - others will be seen in the following paragraphs - because the annual reunion with the characters does not hide the considerable loss of information that motivated sudden changes in the life and behavior of each one.Sensitively directed by the Danish Lone Scherfig (""Education""), who delicately builds the fluid dynamic between Dexter and Emma (Hathaway), One Day is skillful in establishing the passage of time also with the aid of an impeccable make-up job - and notice how Sturgess, in particular, goes from a smooth-faced, jovial boy to a weary middle-aged man with wrinkles and bags under his eyes, while Hathaway emerges chubby (but not exaggeratedly so) after working two years as a waitress in a Mexican restaurant, which is an interesting detail. Benefiting from a competent cast that creates equally complex secondary characters that help compose the journey of the main couple (worth mentioning Rafe Spall, son of Timothy, who transforms the aspiring comedian Ian into a man that is simultaneously pathetic and moving), the film fails here and there by investing in stereotyped characterizations, but still avoiding that they dominate the narrative - and if Dexter's father appears as the typical ""cold and critical father"", Ken Stott manages to make him softer through occasional hesitations that point out his internal effort to try to get closer to the child.Likewise, if Nicholls' dialogues are occasionally forced to appeal to exposition in order to clarify what happened to the characters in the previous year, this is balanced by the good construction of so many other lines (especially those spoken by Hathaway), which they display the cold irony typical of British humor (Emma at one point describes the restaurant where she works as a ""graveyard of ambitions""). As if that were not enough, the script also creates really sensitive interactions between those people, highlighting the brief and beautiful scene between Dexter and his mother, who, played by Patricia Clarkson, shows melancholy and love when telling her son that, even certain that he will be a good man, realizes that he ""isn't there yet"".The dialogues are a strong point of the script, also written by David Nicholls. They are fast, with intelligent insights and manage to perfectly translate the personality of each character and their relationships with each other. Even with silly jokes, like Dexter's mother in Paris saying to her son, ""look over there, Alain Delon"" ... or not, it's your father"", demonstrating how much she is in love with her husband. There are funny scenes too, like when Dexter plays the most famous scene of Spartacus with the dolls for his daughter. But no character is better translated by the dialogues than Emma, the shy girl, but extremely intelligent and sagacious. Each of her lines is a bit of her temperament, feeling, spontaneity.However, it is even in the construction of Dexter and Emma that ""One Day"" proves to be particularly efficient: while the boy quickly achieves professional success, the girl struggles for years trying to make her artistic aspirations viable - a situation that gradually reverses as that we perceive that the former lacks the intellectual, emotional and psychological content that sustains his career, while Emma, growing from suffering, reflection and the simple experience of life, gradually transforms herself into a mature woman and ready to overcome the obstacles that previously prevented it from moving forward (and Sturgess and Hathaway, talented and charismatic, confidently illustrate these changes).The problem is that Hathaway's character quickly becomes the link with the audience. The dreamy sweetness, the sweetness and the detachment transform Emma into a very pleasant company, something that Dexter cannot see. Unsympathetic, self-centered and narcissistic, he uses Emma more as someone to quench the loneliness caused by her personality and assuage her pain and addictions than as a true friendship. Played by the expressionless Sturgess and his characteristic face of suffering, it is practically impossible to believe the beautiful and sensitive Emma fell in love with the guy after a disastrous dinner in which he exposes her (dis)interest. In this way, she emerges as the tragic anchor of the narrative, surrendering herself to the loves of a person she does not love, just to fill the sentimental need. What is revealed in the most cliché of sentences, enunciated according to the Nicholas Sparks booklet: ""she made him decent; you made her happy"".As Emma and Dexter mature, the adolescent, dreamy and inconsequential traits give way to realistic, cynical and disillusioned versions, propelled by tragedies, some of them approached with excessive disregard and disengagement due to the narrative structure - yet another negative effect of this. Elevated to the status of protagonist, an incorrect and questionable decision, Dexter undergoes a wide dramatic arc from his mother's illness (Clarkson), the cancellation of the television program, his marriage to Sylvie (Romola Garai, the young woman from ""Desire and Reparation"" and increasingly better actress), to an event that would definitely humanize him. At times, Emma's life is described in terms of her dream of becoming a writer or her relationship with Ian (Rafe Spall), which is disappointing.By scrutinizing and dissecting fractions of those characters' lives, certain moments should be more appropriately explored in David Nicholls' script. Dexter's firing after a botched interview and being hired on a video game show lacks a glimpse into the character's journey, though we understand what led to this precipitous fall. Similarly, Emma's relationship with Ian, presented at a dinner party without sparks or the guy's inability to make jokes, culminates in the explanation that she can't ""take him watching Wrath of Khan every day anymore"". This excessive exposition becomes constant in the film, requiring that a character needs to contextualize the events that are taking place to the public, which exposes the artificiality of the undertaking; well, if Emma and Dexter are such good friends, it was expected that he would reveal the bad news in the expected time and not months later.On the other hand, the annual narrative is well explored by Danish director Lone Scherfig, and the use of raccords and ellipses in Barney Pilling's montage stands out. And not just temporality, but the duo of characters allows Benoît Delhomme's photography to individualize Emma's trajectory in a nostalgic sepia, while Dexter is bathed in a depressing bluish color palette. Finally, Rachel Portman's score avoids being too intrusive, competently punctuating the narrative. Yes, the idea is curious and the narrative exercise valid (albeit flawed). The trajectory of two people is drawn before our eyes and, let's face it, it's not something usual in novel production. It is a pity, therefore, that the chosen 15th of July sounds hopelessly clichéd and expositional, making the unknown 364 remaining days of each year seem more interesting by comparison.We cannot, however, say that the film is not romantic. It has its moments, even if it prepares us to tears in such an obvious and brief way. Soon we will be in the next year, and the year after that, forgetting the pain and moving on. But that doesn't stop us from living in the moment. They are brief, it is true, but true and well-constructed. Especially in the final act, where we desperately want to go back to the beginning, as an attempt to remake the story, or at least fool our minds with that simple encounter in the middle of the street and a kiss seals the love story that should have been. Director Lone Scherfig managed to bring delicacy to the story of Emma and Dexter, making ""One Day"" a sensitive film. A love story built without resources common to films of this nature. Everything is almost realistic and fearful as life. She regrets that, when the situation picks up, she pulls the rug out from under us, with a cliché situation, announced, made just to make us cry. And she didn't even make it. Still, a good movie of its kind.","8","12 May 2023"
"Likes_Ninjas90","In the late 80s a girl named Emma (Anne Hathaway) is a college student who meets fellow graduate Dexter (Jim Sturgess). They're about to sleep together one evening but decide to remain friends instead. Over the course of twenty years we see how circumstances and other people have kept them divided when they just want to be together. Dexter finds himself hosting a ghastly television show, while being warned by his sick mother (Patricia Clarkson) that he isn't a particularly nice person anymore. He insists that he just wants to have fun, despite being critically panned and moving between women. Emma works her way up from a job in a fast food restaurant, to a teacher and then eventually into a successful author. To the distress of Dexter she has a serious relationship with an obnoxious comedian, which puts her real desires on hold. Late in the timeline, Dexter is married rather unhappily and has a baby girl to look after. An unlikeable leading man makes this one day too many. It's impossible to say what type of movie One Day is. It postures as a comedy but it barely raises a single laugh. And though it also lacks dramatic impact for much of its length too, its one climax is so shocking and over the top that it will leave a sour taste in your mouth. Do not consider this as a date movie. You will not be popular. You also have to wonder late in the movie what the point was. Director Lone Scherfig (An Education, 2009) tries to end things on a very syrupy note. That's very nice for one of the characters but unrewarding for the audience who have waded through twenty years in the lives of these unappealing characters for nothing. The message is ultimately a very obvious, unoriginal and simple one: that life pulls people in opposite directions but happiness can be found in one single moment. Using an extended chronological structure is a gimmick. It allows for little on screen titles to appear in the frame, just like in (500) Days of Summer (2009) but it refuses to enrich character. A film like Blue Valentine (2010) is infinitively more intelligent because it realises that character is structure. It contrasts the past and present day to visualise the changing personalities of its leads and the impact on their relationship. The script by David Nicholls, adapting his own novel, lacks this kind of sophistication. Having the film move through such an extensive period suggests that there will be arching transformations in the characters. But unfortunately Sturgess remains continuously unlikeable all throughout this movie. His character is arrogant, rude, promiscuous and irresponsible. And briefly touching on his fractured relationship with his parents does not make him anymore sympathetic. Patricia Clarkson is barely in this movie because she has so few scenes and I wasn't moved by her appearances as the film intended. One of the golden rules of the romantic comedy is broken here: you don't understand why Emma and Dexter belong together. This is a detriment to the film's plotting and the motives of the characters. We're left wondering what this apparently sophisticated woman continues to see in this buffoon, especially when she's already with better company. Even after that huge climax Dexter still has a moment of madness. Only at the very end does he wake up to himself. The actors aren't really to blame. Anne Hathaway is such a pleasant actress in almost everything she does, comedy or otherwise. But this sketchy, underwritten role wastes her talents and doesn't stretch her chops at all. She's made to look dorky and uptight with her over-sized glasses, only to move into little but quirkiness. And Jim Sturgess who I liked in Across the Universe (2007) and The Way Back (2010) is gifted too, with no shortage of personality. He just happens to be playing a real jerk. If that's what he intended, he certainly succeeded. As far as the rebirth of frank romantic-comedies goes this is a pretty uninspired and limp entry.","1","24 August 2011"
"ianlouisiana","Here in the UK we call people like this ""Up themselves""and I can't think of a film where that description of the characters is more applicable.
One frankly poisonous bloke with his brains in his pants tries for 20 - odd years to seduce a girl he was at university with.
That,basically,is what ""One Day"" is all about.
It's not a love story for heaven sake,he is pathologically incapable of feeling so complex an emotion.
Except towards himself.
She wastes a significant proportion of her life waiting for him to change into a completely different person then,quite inexplicably decides she'll take him on as he is.Maybe she is hearing her biological clock.ticking.
Whatever,she dumps her French jazz pianist boyfriend so quickly he hardly has time to learn the melodic minor scale.
The device on which ""One Day"" hangs is so flimsy I lost interest very early on.
It might have been more winning if the writer had made the ""One Day"" the 29th February - at least it would have been over sooner.
All you need to know about the characters is that they play the terribly posh game ""Are you there,Moriarty"",an Oxbridge version of Blind Man's Buff with added violence .
Under the guise of which the seriously unpleasant guy smacks his girlfriend very hard in the face with a rolled up newspaper,causing her nose to bleed.
She(the lovely Romelai Garai - by far the best performance)still marries him and has his baby.
Well,I never said they were clever.","9","25 February 2018"
"chaz-28","There is a lingering and persistent distraction throughout One Day which severely impairs the audience from becoming absorbed in the film. This is Anne Hathaway's atrocious accent. Many Americans have at varying degrees in the past successfully pulled off a believable British accent. However, Anne Hathaway's character, Emma Morley, sounds at different times Irish, Scottish, and American, but never British. It truly was irritating after awhile. Why didn't the filmmakers just cast a British actress? Or, if they were dead set on Hathaway playing Emma, then move the whole story to America. If not for the distracting aural miscues, this film would most likely be much more enjoyable.Emma and Dexter (Jim Sturgess) meet the night of college graduation at the tail end of an all night party. This is not a meet-cute either. They are the only two left as the last couple pairs off with each other; therefore, fate has thrown them together to have a one night stand. Things get in the way and they end up deciding to be friends and start a very long platonic relationship. This is mostly convincing as Emma is seen to be truly infatuated with Dexter who does not see her in the same light, in fact, he treats her rather poorly as the years go by. Graduation night was July 15th by the way so naturally the pair concocts a plan to meet up annually on that day or at least check in my telephone if this is not possible.Surprisingly, every July 15th is actually a pretty horrible, sad day for each of them. Very rarely is one or both of them in a good mood and happy with where their life is at when the film jumps forward to another July 15th. Furthermore, the film focuses much more on Dexter than Emma with extensive scenes concerning his alcoholism and career missteps. Emma even authors a successful book and it hardly gets a mention until Dexter happens upon it. This made me wonder that if Dexter was to have so much more attention and screen time than Emma, why all the fuss to make Anne Hathaway British? Since the screenplay was written by the same gentlemen who wrote the novel this film is based on, the story's climax is inevitable even though it is forced and manipulative. The scene is also very poorly shot. The director, Lone Scherfig, who made the brilliant An Education two years ago, completely misses the mark with this scene and the rest of the film suffers for it. The event is set up in a way that even people who venture out and see one movie a year will be able to see what is coming up.Another miscue is Patricia Clarkson's role as Dexter's mother. It feels her role has been severely cut during the editing process. Not only does she have dialogue in the preview which is not in the movie, but she only shows up in about two-three scenes, moves the plot along, and then she's out of there. I have not read the novel, but I guarantee she is a much larger presence on those pages than what seems to be a faint echo of her in this movie.P.S. There is an atrocious Elvis Costello song over the closing credits which destroys any lingering fondness or afterthoughts the audience may have been enjoying during the closing scenes.","8","24 August 2011"
"Ali_John_Catterall","Yes, entirely predictably (well, you probably guessed as much from the trailer), they made an utter pig's ear of it. The Good:As Dex, Jim Sturgess is decent - nails the look, and the accent (both of them). Rafe Spall, as hapless wannabe comedian Ian is also fine - although there isn't a scintilla of genuine anguish about him when he's dumped, but hey, it's not his story right? (To be honest, it's a wonder they didn't simply represent him with a balloon on a stick.)It does have a few reflective moments of stillness, which are incredibly welcome - mostly concerning Dex and family (if the book was arguably slanted more towards Emma's side of the story, here it favours Dex) - but they're all too rare.The Bad:All too rare, because this one zips along like it's left the iron on (no mean feat in an 108 minute movie), galloping toward the denouement so that any emotional investment we might have made in it is almost completely wiped out. 1997, for example, literally lasts a swimming pool length. I know book-to-film adaptations bowdlerise to an extent, but this is absolutely ridiculous. There's also an argument to be made about the wisdom of letting writers adapt their own screenplays. Perhaps some sense of objectivity is lost in the process. Oddly enough, a previous David Nicholls' TV mini-series called 'I Saw You', starring Fay Ripley, is practically a warm-up for One Day, and is absolutely wonderful - very worth tracking down. That was in three parts. If the makers of One Day hadn't been so concerned with making a quick buck (usual story), this would have benefited from a mini-series of its own. But then, of course, there's no money in Telly.At its worst, the film's truncation manifests in a reliance on phone calls between the pair, which makes it seem as if Sturgess is frankly *stalking* Anne Hathaway. *That* twist, at least, is intact, and somewhat shocking. But in the same way a sudden glimpse of a mink being flayed alive in the middle of a Disney cartoon might be.Couldn't they have found one single British actress for crying out loud? Yes, I know only too well about the need for overseas investment. But you're not looking at Anne Hathaway thinking, 'working-class Northener' you're distractedly thinking, 'Isn't that... Anne Hathaway, working in a Tex Mex restaurant in Camden?'Romola Garai, who plays Sophie, would have done better - dressed-down a bit. (Or as often suggested, Carey Mulligan.) And how do they pull off Hathaway being only subtly attractive? Oversize specs. Because, you know, specs always make people look *dowdy*, apparently. I'm not even going to talk about her accent. You've heard it. It ranges from Angela's Ashes to... well, to Hathaway's own American accent, in fact.The Ugly:The more I think about this, the crosser I get. Film Emma never has any tawdry affairs, as in the novel, as it wouldn't suit her martyred character - and it wouldn't suit the fragrant Hathaway. A layered, interesting character becomes a 2-dimensional pouter; pure and nun-like. Just waiting around for Dexter to be ready, waiting for him to finally come around, and save her tormented soul. It's repulsive, actually - and *totally* a betrayal of her character and the spirit of the original. In short, it's not the very worst film in the world - it's just completely and utterly unremarkable; Sub-Richard Curtis, which is something this lovely and moving book just isn't.","6","19 August 2011"
"sdebord3136","I was pleasantly surprised by this film. I thought this was going to be another chick flick with a guy flirting with a girl but I found it was an amazing love story that spans 2 decades and gives a glimpse of what true love could really be. Anne H. was great for this because she is a timeless beauty that played her role through the years wonderfully, and Jim S. did a great job evolving with his character through immaturity to understanding. The European setting was beautiful and added to the scenes from the city to country side building the romance of it all.I wish I would have seen it sooner :)","10","20 November 2011"
"axxmy_one","People keep saying that movie adaptations from novels are usually not the same. Some are bad, some are okay, but in this case, it was beautiful. Lots of credit goes to David Nicholls for his excellent screenplay. Everything was PERFECT. Timeline, storyline and even the small details was well written. The acting was impeccable too. What about Anne Hathaway's accent? No problems there. Jim Sturgess plays the character Dexter perfectly. Most people would say that The Notebook is the top romantic teary eyed film. I tell them this: One Day is way better. It shows that two people can have friendship, loyalty, affection and love continuously. Watch it. Whether you have read the book or not, you will fall in love with Dexter & Emma !","7","24 November 2011"
"juneebuggy","I was a huge fan of the book by David Nicholls and really looked foreword to seeing this... And while it didn't quite live up to my expectations and somewhat failed to capture the love and tragedy of the novel it was still a decent enough romance.The lovely Jim Sturgess plays rich playboy Dexter, with the (mostly irritating) Anne Hathaway as working class woman Em. We join them in 1988 on the night of their college graduation where they almost get together, decide to be friends and then proceed to follow them over the course of the next two decades.We see them through assorted relationships, phone calls, fights, hopes, vacations, missed opportunities, laughter and tears. There is always the anticipation of, will these two ever get together? The tone of the movie is different than the book, trying to be a bit like 'When Harry Met Sally' and failing. I also didn't ever feel the connection between Dexter and Em. I guess I should stop comparing the two, apples and oranges and all that but when you adore a book as much as I did its hard.The ageing of the characters is very well done here, subtle but especially apparent at the very end when the movie flips back to the night they met and you go wow, look how young they were. The clothing is also true to the decade and there are some fun (bad) hairstyles. 1/4/15","10","1 April 2015"
"neil-476","I give advance notice that I am going to be spoilering fairly extensively as this review goes on: you have been warned. Spoiler-free synopsis: Emma and Dexter meet on the day they graduate from university (July 15th 1988): there is an instant connection, and they nearly do the deed, but not quite. Instead, they enter into a long-term friendship which we, the audience, look in on every year on the anniversary of their meeting. Without giving anything away at this point, Emma becomes a waitress and would-be author who takes up with an unsuccessful stand-up comedian, and Dexter becomes a promiscuous TV presenter. We can see that that, ideally, they should be together because Emma desperately loves Dexter, and would be able to turn him from the louche, dissolute rake he has become into the decent man he has the potential to be. But, as the years go by, they always shy away from it. Anne Hathaway plays Emma and Jim Sturgess plays Dexter.Let me comment on a couple of points frequently mentioned elsewhere. One, I had no problem with Anne Hathaway's accent. It was, mostly, a tolerable all purpose moderately well-spoken British accent, with occasional ""oop north"" flattened vowels unnecessarily thrown in. It didn't distract me. Two, I understand that the book is a big hit with a chunk of the audience (the cinema audience was mostly older women in pairs, some with husbands dragged along. I was the only solo male). I haven't read the book, so I have no comment as to how well the film represented it.This film irritated me. I recognise that I am not part of the target demographic for a romantic drama, but I can be reached: my tear glands are perfectly prepared to well up in appropriate circumstances. However, I left the cinema dry-eyed and stony-faced: this film did not touch me in the slightest.I think I was irritated with it right from the start. A young man, subsequently shown to be highly promiscuous, ends up in bed with a girl who is ready and willing, and then - nothing happens? No, I don't think so. From then onwards I was constantly aware of the attempted pushing of emotional manipulation buttons, and it just didn't work. I thought the acting was fine, the period atmosphere good despite the odd anachronism, but I couldn't see why these two totally dissimilar people were soulmates, nor why they kept in touch, what she saw in him - in short, nothing about the emotional side of the film worked for me at all.OK, now I'm going to get really spoilery. And then, after donkeys' years go by, and things go pear shaped for him, Dexter finally learns a bit of humility by which time Emma has found herself a French jazz pianist. She instantly dumps the poor pianist and takes up with Dexter. While trying for a baby of their own (he already has a daughter by a previous relationship), she - really, I'm warning you, stop reading now if you don't want to hit a B.I.G. spoiler - is killed in a traffic accident. We then enter the final section of the film which attempts to have its cake and eat it. Intercut with each other we see Dexter coming to terms with life after Emma's death, in touching (but all not that touching!) conversations with his daughter and Emma's old stand-up comedian boyfriend, plus we see a kind of re-set button version of the day Dexter and Emma first got together which leads us towards the more satisfying relationship they could have had/did have (?) For all these years.And that irritated me even more.I was never uninterested in what went on, but I should have been moved by this film, and I wasn't - and I think it is because it was full of emotional dishonesty from start to finish.","9","26 August 2011"
"jmc4769","I just got back home from seeing this movie, and I feel like I've been hit upside the head with a baseball bat. I'm a sucker for romantic movies, and I've sat through hundreds of mediocre ones that were watchable anyway. But One Day had to be one of the worst romance movies I have ever had the misfortune to endure. It was especially disappointing because I've loved Anne Hathaway in just about everything she's been in (Princess Diaries, Ella Enchanted, Rachel Getting Married, The Devil Wears Prada, Rio, etc.). One Day has few redeeming qualities, except for the occasional pretty scenery. The most serious problem is Jim Sturgess's character, Dexter. Dexter is an unlikable, shallow womanizer. I know what you're thinking: Charming womanizers are a staple of these movies. But Sturgess gives Dexter no charm, no glimmer of humanity, no hint that there may be lovable qualities beneath his contemptible persona. The usually wonderful Hathaway (Emma) gets mired down here in a bad script. And there is not the tiniest spark of chemistry between the two. I kept thinking, ""Come on, Emma, block this loser's number and take out a restraining order."" When the inevitable romance comes, it hasn't a shred of believability. This movie ultimately amounts to a plain Jane wish-fulfillment fantasy (yep, Hathaway is supposed to be plain)...sort of like those movies where the nerdy guy gets the hot girl. The plot structure is a big problem too. We see the main characters only on one day (July 15th) of every year from 1988 to 2011. Instead of continuity, character development, and relationship development, we get mostly uninteresting snippets of their lives. The final straw for me though was the surprise ending, which was a completely gratuitous attempt to insert meaningful drama into an otherwise vacuous movie. At this point, I was begging for the movie to be over, but no such luck. Incredibly, screenwriter (and author of the book of the same name), David Nicholls, drags this bad movie out for another 15 minutes or so.","9","19 August 2011"
"851222","Greetings from Lithuania.I don't watch romantic movies often, but when i heard about story of ""One day"" i thought of giving it a chance. And it sure didn't disappoint me. This is a really good love story, told in a single day in a year in period of 23 years. Movie is beautifully filmed, with great acting by the two leads, especially from Anne Hathaway. She's just so ... beautiful in every meaning of this word. Can't wait to see her next summer in ""TDKR"". ""One day"" isn't your typical Hollywood love story and you can clearly FEEL that watching it. Give this movie a chance and you can be really surprised that when this movie will end, you'll fell your self a little ... brighter.","4","16 October 2011"
"achyutaghosh","Disclaimer first up- biased review, as I am a sucker for love stories.I used to think that Hollywood had stopped making emotionally involving love stories. Thank god they made One Day, then. Based on the best selling book by British author Dave Nicholls, the movie explores the intertwined lives of two protagonists of contrasting nature, yet fated to be together. The premise is novel, with the relationship explored though a peek into 15th July of each year, spread over 22 years. Good stories are brought to life by good acting, and here we have two superb exponents in lead roles- Jim Sturgess as Dexter and Anna Hathaway as Emma. Dexter leads the high profile life, a television anchor with success in all forms chasing him, always. But then his life is also hollow, his friends shallow, and in the end, a faces disillusionment and compromise. Emma dwells in obscurity mostly, but through sheer tenacity and belief achieves a modicum of success as a writer. They meet when they are 18, decide to remain lifelong friends, and they do remain so. In the meanwhile meandering through the vagaries of life, they are inexorably drawn towards each other, dependent on each other.Childhood sweethearts, even if long lost, when they do come together, they do get together without any questions asked- i say this having witnessed the same on a close friend of mine. And you cant help but fall in love with Emma and Dexter- their love story is so compelling and adorable, that you become a part of their story, you care for them, you laugh with them, and also cry, you want them to do what you would do, and yes, you desperately want a happy ending for them.And of course there is Anna Hathaway-suitably rumpled and grunge in the first half, and elegance and grace personified in the second, when she flashes her pearly whites, the world seems to be a better place to live.Why do people in love get to be in love in the best of locations? One Day happens in picturesque Edinburgh, colourful London, and stylish Paris. And the best thing that makes it stand out among all love stories is that it is not predictable, till the very end. People and things change with time, but memories remain the same.- here's a movie that raises a toast to happy memories, a Must watch for mushy folks!","5","23 November 2011"
"Philby-3","One Day Two eighties graduates in Edinburgh have an encounter on graduation day, July 15th ; the film follows their relationship by annual updates. Dexter (Jim Sturgess) brilliant, charismatic and a total narcissist and Emma (Ann Hathaway), a demure, warm sort are not a great match and both hitch up with others, but their friendship endures.The film is romantic, but only to a point, and can hardly be described as a comedy; there is too much pain for that, despite some funny dialogue. It is a kind of growing older movie – early promise turning sour, bright young ambitious things tasting failure and settling for something less. The story is cleverly told and nicely shot, with good support from Ken Stott and Patricia Clarkson as Dexter's disapproving parents and Rhys Spall as Emma's husband. Jim Sturgess looks and acts uncannily like a younger Rupert Graves, who has portrayed a long line of charming handsome wastrels. Ann Hathaway might be from New York but she plays Emma perfectly – the dialect coaches really earned their money. Both of the principals manage to evoke our sympathy, though Sturgess has the harder job.July 15 is St Swithin's day. On that day in 1415 the English Army led by Henry V (alias Laurence Olivier or Kenneth Branagh) defeated a larger French force at Agincourt. This has absolutely nothing to do with the movie though Dexter and Emma do at one stage venture to Brittany, where they manage to lose their clothes in one of the film's more comedic moments.I couldn't help feeling the story arc was rather predictable but I was absorbed nonetheless. At the end I'm not sure what the attraction was for Emma – she was smart enough to realise Dexter was a jerk but somehow she couldn't resist. He does get better – perhaps deep down she wanted to reform him. Or perhaps deep down she wanted to be a bit wild too. A film for generation Xers who are wondering what the hell happened to their youthful dreams and plans.","9","14 September 2011"
"napierslogs","""One Day"", based on the novel of the same name, is the relationship of two people, Emma (Anne Hathaway) and Dexter (Jim Sturgess), as we see it on July 15th of each year. As can be expected from the nature of the story, it's a little dry, lacking in comedy. But then again, it's a romantic drama, not a romantic comedy.As is the nature of the two media, movies can never be exactly the same as the novel. But the problem with this one is that they tried to; no story lines were removed. Almost everything was there, just shortened into mostly meaningless segments. I personally could have done with one less event in their lives, and perhaps a different ending, but they tried to be as faithful as possible.What we have here is a movie about a relationship, but the novel was about the people. They traded in character depth and development so we can see them in their more attractive years falling in and out of love.I wasn't very familiar with Jim Sturgess, having seen him play skinny, slightly nerdy, not as confident kids. Dexter is a different breed of guy. Just has high on self-confidence as he is on drugs and alcohol, he gets by on his looks – literally – he's a TV host. Although the different characteristics of Dexter weren't explicitly shown in the movie, Sturgess brought them out in him perfectly. Emma is a more complex character, with significant evolution to who she is throughout the years, except none of that is in the movie, so it just wasn't really possible for Hathaway to portray her as a more interesting person.I would assume that watching ""One Day"" without the benefit of having read the novel would be a fairly confusing, empty experience. With the background that the novel gave me, I could fill in all the missing years and the unexplored layers to the characters, so there was still something to their relationship for me.","7","19 August 2011"
"TheBobbyjames","Very seldom in Hollywood are movies produced that are as emotionally involving as 'One Day.' It's a beautiful, beautiful love story of two people, Emma (Anne Hathaway) and Dex (Jim Sturgess). After spending the night together after graduation, we are taken on a journey into their lives for one day each year after they met; to see where they are or where they're not. Based on the book by David Nicholls (who also wrote the screenplay), 'One Day' transitions from novel to film brilliantly.First let me say film acting is what I believe makes or breaks a movie - if the actors are great, the movie is generally great. That's not to take away from any other element of film at all, but when everything else is done so well, if the acting were bad, the film would have been less memorable. But Anne Hathaway and Jim Sturgess are so very impressive here. They make their characters real and relatable, which are two key things every actor internally wishes they could do. In fact, as an on-screen pair, they work extremely well, together they exude chemistry.What I found most interesting about the entire experience was that I cared so much. I became enamoured with their lives. I kept hoping for the best. I anticipated what would happen to each of them. I sat forward, sat backward. I laughed and I cried. I've said many times before, a great movie will effect you emotionally in more ways than one. You'll be angry, you'll be happy, you'll be sad - the key is that you emote. This movie presented all of those elements. It was fresh and witty and everything you hope a movie will be. It's as beautifully made as it is acted and the locations are exquisite. Far too often, characters in Hollywood seem contrived and are not genuine. 'One Day' is honestly one of the most genuine stories ever told - there is no instant gratification, there is however frustration and that is the beauty of it all. It explores love and love lost, it explores friendship and the constraints of time and distance. It explores each character's journey to happiness and the trials they face along the way. So many little pieces of the puzzle are filled in between the years by simple, single lines of dialogue or actions. It's not the typical script of ""everything's all good-obstacle-everything ends well"" - there's a lot more complexity which makes it realistically genuine.So many little details, like eye-lines, smiles, sighs, cut-off conversations, etc. were paid attention to. The costuming, cinematography and score were spot on and all noteworthy. All of it combined was moving and awe-inspiring. I left the theater crying, but it didn't stop there, even thinking about the movie and those characters is deeply affecting. Maybe there are some underlying themes in the film that I'm identifying with, or maybe, just maybe the actors were really that great. Whatever it is, this film comes with my highest recommendation, is rated PG-13 and runs 107 minutes.","8","31 August 2011"
"TheLittleSongbird","The book was a wonderful read. One Day was a movie I was looking forward to, and while it was disappointing I found it very pleasant.What made the book so good and such a joy to read was not just the emotional impact, modern angst and characterisation but also how nostalgic it made me. The emotional impact and angst is here in the movie, what wasn't quite there was the nostalgia-evidence of it but could've been more- and characterisation which does feel choppy especially with Patricia Clarkson's Alison though Dexter is well realised.That said, I loved the beautiful look of the film, the soundtrack which gave the film its sense of nostalgia and the witty banter between Sturgess and Hathaway. The romantic elements are touching though the comedic elements don't always work coming across as a tad contrived. The direction is decent, the telling of the story is well paced(if somewhat glacial) and faithful and the script has some nice touches but also some weak ones. Of the support performances I thought Rafe Spall, Romola Garai and Ken Stott were the most effective and Clarkson was good if deserving of more to do. The picture belongs to Jim Sturgess, while staying true to his bad boy character of Dexter he also manages to be sympathetic.My feelings on Anne Hathaway were mixed. I loved her radiance and her chemistry with Sturgess, but her accent was inconsistent and felt forced and unnatural whenever she tried it. The shock ending also felt more bewildering than anything else, not the actual tragedy itself but rather the flashbacks that succeeded that I wasn't sure was really needed.In conclusion, pleasant if not entirely successful. 6.5/10 Bethany Cox","7","31 August 2011"
"JimmyCollins","Words cannot describe how wonderful an actress Anne Hathaway is, and in One Day she is in fine form, if there ever was an actress to go down in the history books among the greats it would be her. Jim Sturgess is quite a charming devil swell.The story that takes place in One Day is at moments the anti love story and other times a sweeping epic romance, even though this movie has been adapted from a book it's still a lot more original than other romantic themed films of late. Lone Scherfig definitely suits this style of English romance, starting with An Education and now this, it may sound mean but I just don't think the romantic dramas that come from the U.S have the same genuine feel that the English films do.I had read the book and i have to say that this is a very loyal adaptation, much of the beauty from the book is clear and present here, particularly the friendship aspect between Dex and Emma, in the book it's a quirky kind of friendship and it transferred well on the screen as, I was very pleased that the film makers didn't ruin that with a cheap silly sexual type of friendship.I could say a lot about how lovely this movie is but I think I'll let everyone make up their own mind. A lot of people have a bad opinion of this movie which I find baffling but I suppose each to their own, I just got totally wrapped up in this gorgeous romance.10 out of 10","4","3 September 2011"
"queen_of_naboo88","I went to see One Day last night, and though I had been looking forward to it for a while, I was surprised at how good it actually is. The film has a very unique atmosphere, as it is much quirkier than your average romance. Also, without giving away the ending, I can say that it isn't as predictable as one might think. What I really liked about it was the complexity of the different human relationships that we are shown. The relationship between Emma and Dexter is by no means an easy one, nor is it one-sided. Given how different they are, there is a lot of conflict between them, although they do love each other. Similarly, what Dexter and his ex-wife feel for one another is never pure hatred, but there is a lot of understanding between them. As a consequence, the story seems like it could be taken from real life. Plus, both Hathaway and Sturgess are as convincing as always, which makes this film absolutely worth seeing.","3","19 August 2011"
"guest_pabby","After perusing other reviews for this movie, I believe that many of the ratings are low, not because viewers disliked the movie, but because they disliked the element in which the film shines. The film succeeds in drawing the audience into the friendship between the main characters, played by Jim Sturgess and Anne Hathaway. Both characters find happiness and meaning in parts of their lives, while suffering through other portions without attaining goals they've set for themselves; i.e., this is real life.What the poorly-rating reviewers seek is escapism. In my view--however limited--this film aims to depict two human beings as they learn, grow, and fall in and out of touch with one another. Thus, don't expect any fairy tales here and don't punish the rating on this movie because it isn't a fairy tale! A predictable conclusion to this movie would place Sturgess and Hathaway side by side, married, and living together untouched by the trials of a realistic relationship. Instead, the director effectively and with calculation showcases some of life in the scenes and merely hints at events not shown on the screen. As the film narrates exclusively through one date each year (hence, the name), partial narratives are expected. The final third of the film, shunned by a few reviewers, elevated the creative vision of the story because it introduces the unpredictable nature of real life into a movie that was otherwise a run-of-the-mill romance. Again, speaking in terms of the development between characters, the movie is above average. Speaking in terms of storyline, the first two-thirds, to a certain degree, lack what the final third delivers: surprise! The juxtaposition of the present with the past near the end of this film makes the events even more potent than they would have been. Audience members who do not fall into the ""half-wit"" category can follow the story, regardless of what the viewers who read the novel state in their reviews. Bravo! Lastly, Anne Hathaway is exceedingly lovely.","3","3 September 2011"
"ferguson-6","Greetings again from the darkness. I have not read David Nicholls' novel, but my understanding is that it is extremely well written and its loyal readers really connected with Emma and Dexter. If that's true, then this film version is even worse than I thought while watching.This literally is my least favorite type of movie. A movie that assumes its viewers are unable to think for themselves or judge the actions of its characters. In other words, the filmmakers take for granted that we will accept whatever is shown on the big screen.First let me say that I completely understand the school girl crush that a young Emma (Anne Hathaway) has on her classmate Dexter (Jim Sturgess). He is handsome and charismatic and comes from more money than she. I also understand Dexter's attraction to the lovely Emma. She is very pretty - despite the ridiculous over-sized glasses for the early scenes - and very intelligent, and a significantly nicer person than he.What makes absolutely no sense to me is her continued attraction to this drunken, empty soul for the next twenty years. She is too smart to pine away the years hoping he will wise up and coming running to her. We are supposed to believe that she has no interest in any other relationship other than the non-threatening one with flopping stand-up comedian Ian (played by Timothy Spall's son Rafe) and a ""boring"" French Jazz Pianist.Dexter's mother is played by Patricia Clarkson. As she is dying from cancer, she tells him that she believes he will grow into a good man, but isn't there yet. I guess we are supposed to take her word for it. Instead we only see Dexter go from a selfish pig as a TV personality to a defeated man who must perform manual labor for the first time in his life. My issue is that a defeated man is not necessarily a good man. A man resigned to his life has not necessarily reached enlightenment. Where is Emma's proof that he deserves her? Where is the indication that her life with him will be better? I tell you where ... in the mind of that school girl from years ago.Please don't mistake my words as that of one who has no faith in romantic stories. There are so many ways this story could have turned that it would have had me. Instead it chose a path that assumed I was ignorant ... totally accepting of ridiculous story being laid out for me.My final comments on the film involve the cast. Anne Hathaway is an incredibly talented performer. She is not, however, British. Her accent is terribly distracting. Jim Sturgess is a handsome guy, but just not charismatic enough to pull off the TV personality role. Patricia Clarkson is a fantastic actress, but she is not British either. Seriously, are there not enough British actresses? The casting smells like a money-grubbing production team. As for director Lone Scherfig ... her previous film An Education was cinematic excellence. This is an unacceptable follow-up and we expect better next time.I will say the locations of Edinburg, London and Paris were beautiful and different than we usually get from the movies. That provided the only real enjoyment from this highly disappointing movie.","8","21 August 2011"
"Rob-O-Cop","this had some great aspects to it but ultimately failed to deliver. Firstly the good. Brilliant locations, beautiful cinematography, Anne Hathaway delivers a good performance,The bad. The editor and the director failed to establish a believable connection between the two lead actors as to why they would form a lasting bond that would carry them over 20 years. We're given a hint of this at the end but that doesn't help or fix the rest of the movie, so that's the bad editing aspect of this. if this scene had been at the front it might have helped sell the movie. That that scene didn't really deliver the goods needed to make it believable is the directors mistake along with many of the other scenes that tips the scale against the characters. Too many scenes of Dexter being a jerk and not enough of him being in anyway lovable or charming, even though there was much amusement to be had in the jerk Dexter scenes they blew out the balance of his character and it wasn't till the end that we got to see him as anything less than a jerk, but by then it was too late and it didn't really do anything to alter the confusion of why Emma would have cared. I also didn't buy Jim Sturgess performance, although a lot of people think differently, he came across as a caricature rather than a character. People have criticised Anne Hathaway's accent and there's probably some weight to that but I personally didn't find it annoying once I thought what's going on with her accent as it fluctuated all over the show. That's a continuity and a direction flaw as much as it is her performance. After a few mins I put it in the multi-sourced accent file as many people have blended accents. Outside of that Anne's delivering some really good depth in her work so much so that we may one day forgive her for the princess diaries.","10","27 January 2012"
"francine-k","I had watched ""One Day"" yesterday and was beyond excited because I had read the novel by David Nicholls, which was fantastic. The movie base's around 2 people and their twenty years together, shown only through one day, July 15th. I thought the plot was unique and was a very realistic romance. Sometimes it takes people a lot to lose to realize what life is about, and how certain people are truly important to you. The movie was cute, funny, and quite sad at times. I thought Anne Hathaway did an okay job on the accent, to me it was odd at first but after a couple minutes I had gotten used to it. Her acting was great and you can really see her changing as the years progress. Jim Sturgess was great and in my opinion really portrayed Dexter the best as possible, with the arrogance and attitude exactly as I imagined Dexter would have. In my own opinion the movie was a great watch, was a romance that I had been dying for ever sense The Notebook. Finally a tear jerking but smile at the end movie, that really anyone can enjoy, if your looking for a romance movie.","9","20 August 2011"
"JohnDeSando","One Day is promoted as drama romance and not a rom com. On all three counts I would call it out anyway, for it is a melodramatic, episodic tale of two best friends in London, Emma (Anne Hathaway) and Dexter (Jim Sturgess), who flirt with love over a long period but play on the standard cliché that requires they eventually end up together, regardless how many marriages and children intervene.One Day has too many short episodes from college in the '80's until professional life in 2011, and each seems just a variation on another before it: boy gets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl back again, well, you know the routine. During all these little skirmishes Emma remains wholesome (no stretch for the perpetually cute Hathaway, reminding me of Sally Hawkins' Poppy in Mike Leigh's Happy Go Lucky. But without Hawkins' charisma).Dexter is a cad and Lothario almost all the way, making him unlikeable and difficult to gain our sympathy. His cavalier treatment of his mother (the ever-interesting Patricia Clarkson) and father (Ken Stott) adds to his surly persona. In addition, Sturgess needs a little coaching or better script if he wishes to catch up with the Ryans (Gosling and Reynolds) in the emerging leading-man lineup.Nowhere do I feel a real sexual heat, especially since in most of the film they are avowing to be just friends. Moreover in the numerous years/episodes I do not feel the intellectual and emotional connection that comes so naturally in Richard Linklater's Before Sunrise/Sunset series. Even director Lone Scherfig's Parisian scenes are vacant, poor cousins to Woody Allen's romantic City of Lights in Midnight in Paris.As an Anglophile, I usually can forgive many sins if a film gives me an adequate dose of the great city, but as with the Paris background, romance takes a holiday even from the cities.","8","23 August 2011"
"blanbrn","Over the summer I saw this film sure it's typical chick flick, still as a male I admire the beauty and sexy look of Anne Hathaway who I think is a brilliant actress. Plus I think she pulled the international accent off just fine in this film and as always her look is sharp and just fine. This is a love story that spans time with memories these moments touch you staying with you forever despite when an unexpected tragedy strikes.Set in England it involves a couple Em(Anne Hathaway) and Dexter(Jim Sturgess) and after this international couple graduates from college and meet and fall for one another on July 15, 1989. From every year on on this date it's considered an anniversary for this couple as the film shows the special moments that happened during the lives of both. As each year on the same day is highlighted you see that no matter what path their lives have taken love and memories draw them together.Overall this is a film of memory and everlasting love sadly an unexpected tragedy occurs, but still with memories Dexter will love Em forever as long as memories are around love can last forever. Probably not a great film but worth a watch for any Anne Hathaway fan.","1","10 October 2011"
"jeffallenhammer","Does life imitate art or does art imitate life? I'm one who tends to avoid the discussion entirely by saying ""both."" One Day is the most real (save a few accents) movie I've seen in a long time. It explores time and how it often slips away from us. Our hearts' desires are often decimated by bad timing, and the movie finds a variety of ways to demonstrate this. So in the case of One Day, art imitates life to the fullest, as we can all sympathize (if only a little) to crushed hopes and shattered dreams, though hopefully we eventually find our way.Anne Hathaway stars as insecure working-class woman Emma, who, for one reason or another is drawn to Dexter, (Jim Sturgess) a charming upper middle class man with a great amount of self-confidence. It may be hard to understand just what the two have on each other, but they are characters I'm familiar with. The woman who is way too into a man that's way too into himself, it happens and for the type, Dex is pretty likable. Em and Dex have nothing in common. But their opposite personalities do what a relationship should; make each other better. They are Yin and Yang, complementary opposites.An interesting technique used by One Day, is that we only get to see the events of a single day, July 15, for each of 20 plus years. Some of my peers have taken to calling this a gimmick. In a year where it seems every other film is either a sequel or a remake/reboot, (which critics and public alike have grown tired of) I feel fresh ideas should be applauded, even if it doesn't quite work. For me, however, it worked to perfection. Director Lone Scherfig (An Education) paints the picture of Em and Dex's up and down relationship with great finesse, never having too much happen on the date year to year. The filmmaker fills us in on what has taken place throughout each year, without conversations seeming inorganic. The cinematography is beautiful, especially a scene where our would-be lovers break all their rules by taking a dip at sunset. There's plenty of humor, joy, sadness, regret and a number of other emotions to be felt. I caution viewers that this isn't a romantic comedy, nor does it end like one. One Day is, however, easily one of the most heartfelt films of the year and should be celebrated for its bravery.",NA,"31 August 2011"
"fernandoschiavi","Based on David Nichols' bestseller, ""One Day"" is a more mature Nicholas Sparks version, but equally tearful and melodramatic. Based on a peculiar and intriguing narrative structure, which revisits the 15th of July in the lives of Dexter and Emma since 1988 over more than 20 years, the story focuses on the maturation of the relationship between its characters, fleeing the punctuality and immediacy that surrounds most novels. Ironically, this same artifice reveals the main weakness of the script - others will be seen in the following paragraphs - because the annual reunion with the characters does not hide the considerable loss of information that motivated sudden changes in the life and behavior of each one.Sensitively directed by the Danish Lone Scherfig (""Education""), who delicately builds the fluid dynamic between Dexter and Emma (Hathaway), One Day is skillful in establishing the passage of time also with the aid of an impeccable make-up job - and notice how Sturgess, in particular, goes from a smooth-faced, jovial boy to a weary middle-aged man with wrinkles and bags under his eyes, while Hathaway emerges chubby (but not exaggeratedly so) after working two years as a waitress in a Mexican restaurant, which is an interesting detail. Benefiting from a competent cast that creates equally complex secondary characters that help compose the journey of the main couple (worth mentioning Rafe Spall, son of Timothy, who transforms the aspiring comedian Ian into a man that is simultaneously pathetic and moving), the film fails here and there by investing in stereotyped characterizations, but still avoiding that they dominate the narrative - and if Dexter's father appears as the typical ""cold and critical father"", Ken Stott manages to make him softer through occasional hesitations that point out his internal effort to try to get closer to the child.Likewise, if Nicholls' dialogues are occasionally forced to appeal to exposition in order to clarify what happened to the characters in the previous year, this is balanced by the good construction of so many other lines (especially those spoken by Hathaway), which they display the cold irony typical of British humor (Emma at one point describes the restaurant where she works as a ""graveyard of ambitions""). As if that were not enough, the script also creates really sensitive interactions between those people, highlighting the brief and beautiful scene between Dexter and his mother, who, played by Patricia Clarkson, shows melancholy and love when telling her son that, even certain that he will be a good man, realizes that he ""isn't there yet"".The dialogues are a strong point of the script, also written by David Nicholls. They are fast, with intelligent insights and manage to perfectly translate the personality of each character and their relationships with each other. Even with silly jokes, like Dexter's mother in Paris saying to her son, ""look over there, Alain Delon"" ... or not, it's your father"", demonstrating how much she is in love with her husband. There are funny scenes too, like when Dexter plays the most famous scene of Spartacus with the dolls for his daughter. But no character is better translated by the dialogues than Emma, the shy girl, but extremely intelligent and sagacious. Each of her lines is a bit of her temperament, feeling, spontaneity.However, it is even in the construction of Dexter and Emma that ""One Day"" proves to be particularly efficient: while the boy quickly achieves professional success, the girl struggles for years trying to make her artistic aspirations viable - a situation that gradually reverses as that we perceive that the former lacks the intellectual, emotional and psychological content that sustains his career, while Emma, growing from suffering, reflection and the simple experience of life, gradually transforms herself into a mature woman and ready to overcome the obstacles that previously prevented it from moving forward (and Sturgess and Hathaway, talented and charismatic, confidently illustrate these changes).The problem is that Hathaway's character quickly becomes the link with the audience. The dreamy sweetness, the sweetness and the detachment transform Emma into a very pleasant company, something that Dexter cannot see. Unsympathetic, self-centered and narcissistic, he uses Emma more as someone to quench the loneliness caused by her personality and assuage her pain and addictions than as a true friendship. Played by the expressionless Sturgess and his characteristic face of suffering, it is practically impossible to believe the beautiful and sensitive Emma fell in love with the guy after a disastrous dinner in which he exposes her (dis)interest. In this way, she emerges as the tragic anchor of the narrative, surrendering herself to the loves of a person she does not love, just to fill the sentimental need. What is revealed in the most cliché of sentences, enunciated according to the Nicholas Sparks booklet: ""she made him decent; you made her happy"".As Emma and Dexter mature, the adolescent, dreamy and inconsequential traits give way to realistic, cynical and disillusioned versions, propelled by tragedies, some of them approached with excessive disregard and disengagement due to the narrative structure - yet another negative effect of this. Elevated to the status of protagonist, an incorrect and questionable decision, Dexter undergoes a wide dramatic arc from his mother's illness (Clarkson), the cancellation of the television program, his marriage to Sylvie (Romola Garai, the young woman from ""Desire and Reparation"" and increasingly better actress), to an event that would definitely humanize him. At times, Emma's life is described in terms of her dream of becoming a writer or her relationship with Ian (Rafe Spall), which is disappointing.By scrutinizing and dissecting fractions of those characters' lives, certain moments should be more appropriately explored in David Nicholls' script. Dexter's firing after a botched interview and being hired on a video game show lacks a glimpse into the character's journey, though we understand what led to this precipitous fall. Similarly, Emma's relationship with Ian, presented at a dinner party without sparks or the guy's inability to make jokes, culminates in the explanation that she can't ""take him watching Wrath of Khan every day anymore"". This excessive exposition becomes constant in the film, requiring that a character needs to contextualize the events that are taking place to the public, which exposes the artificiality of the undertaking; well, if Emma and Dexter are such good friends, it was expected that he would reveal the bad news in the expected time and not months later.On the other hand, the annual narrative is well explored by Danish director Lone Scherfig, and the use of raccords and ellipses in Barney Pilling's montage stands out. And not just temporality, but the duo of characters allows Benoît Delhomme's photography to individualize Emma's trajectory in a nostalgic sepia, while Dexter is bathed in a depressing bluish color palette. Finally, Rachel Portman's score avoids being too intrusive, competently punctuating the narrative. Yes, the idea is curious and the narrative exercise valid (albeit flawed). The trajectory of two people is drawn before our eyes and, let's face it, it's not something usual in novel production. It is a pity, therefore, that the chosen 15th of July sounds hopelessly clichéd and expositional, making the unknown 364 remaining days of each year seem more interesting by comparison.We cannot, however, say that the film is not romantic. It has its moments, even if it prepares us to tears in such an obvious and brief way. Soon we will be in the next year, and the year after that, forgetting the pain and moving on. But that doesn't stop us from living in the moment. They are brief, it is true, but true and well-constructed. Especially in the final act, where we desperately want to go back to the beginning, as an attempt to remake the story, or at least fool our minds with that simple encounter in the middle of the street and a kiss seals the love story that should have been. Director Lone Scherfig managed to bring delicacy to the story of Emma and Dexter, making ""One Day"" a sensitive film. A love story built without resources common to films of this nature. Everything is almost realistic and fearful as life. She regrets that, when the situation picks up, she pulls the rug out from under us, with a cliché situation, announced, made just to make us cry. And she didn't even make it. Still, a good movie of its kind.",NA,"12 May 2023"
"Likes_Ninjas90","In the late 80s a girl named Emma (Anne Hathaway) is a college student who meets fellow graduate Dexter (Jim Sturgess). They're about to sleep together one evening but decide to remain friends instead. Over the course of twenty years we see how circumstances and other people have kept them divided when they just want to be together. Dexter finds himself hosting a ghastly television show, while being warned by his sick mother (Patricia Clarkson) that he isn't a particularly nice person anymore. He insists that he just wants to have fun, despite being critically panned and moving between women. Emma works her way up from a job in a fast food restaurant, to a teacher and then eventually into a successful author. To the distress of Dexter she has a serious relationship with an obnoxious comedian, which puts her real desires on hold. Late in the timeline, Dexter is married rather unhappily and has a baby girl to look after. An unlikeable leading man makes this one day too many. It's impossible to say what type of movie One Day is. It postures as a comedy but it barely raises a single laugh. And though it also lacks dramatic impact for much of its length too, its one climax is so shocking and over the top that it will leave a sour taste in your mouth. Do not consider this as a date movie. You will not be popular. You also have to wonder late in the movie what the point was. Director Lone Scherfig (An Education, 2009) tries to end things on a very syrupy note. That's very nice for one of the characters but unrewarding for the audience who have waded through twenty years in the lives of these unappealing characters for nothing. The message is ultimately a very obvious, unoriginal and simple one: that life pulls people in opposite directions but happiness can be found in one single moment. Using an extended chronological structure is a gimmick. It allows for little on screen titles to appear in the frame, just like in (500) Days of Summer (2009) but it refuses to enrich character. A film like Blue Valentine (2010) is infinitively more intelligent because it realises that character is structure. It contrasts the past and present day to visualise the changing personalities of its leads and the impact on their relationship. The script by David Nicholls, adapting his own novel, lacks this kind of sophistication. Having the film move through such an extensive period suggests that there will be arching transformations in the characters. But unfortunately Sturgess remains continuously unlikeable all throughout this movie. His character is arrogant, rude, promiscuous and irresponsible. And briefly touching on his fractured relationship with his parents does not make him anymore sympathetic. Patricia Clarkson is barely in this movie because she has so few scenes and I wasn't moved by her appearances as the film intended. One of the golden rules of the romantic comedy is broken here: you don't understand why Emma and Dexter belong together. This is a detriment to the film's plotting and the motives of the characters. We're left wondering what this apparently sophisticated woman continues to see in this buffoon, especially when she's already with better company. Even after that huge climax Dexter still has a moment of madness. Only at the very end does he wake up to himself. The actors aren't really to blame. Anne Hathaway is such a pleasant actress in almost everything she does, comedy or otherwise. But this sketchy, underwritten role wastes her talents and doesn't stretch her chops at all. She's made to look dorky and uptight with her over-sized glasses, only to move into little but quirkiness. And Jim Sturgess who I liked in Across the Universe (2007) and The Way Back (2010) is gifted too, with no shortage of personality. He just happens to be playing a real jerk. If that's what he intended, he certainly succeeded. As far as the rebirth of frank romantic-comedies goes this is a pretty uninspired and limp entry.",NA,"24 August 2011"
"ianlouisiana","Here in the UK we call people like this ""Up themselves""and I can't think of a film where that description of the characters is more applicable.
One frankly poisonous bloke with his brains in his pants tries for 20 - odd years to seduce a girl he was at university with.
That,basically,is what ""One Day"" is all about.
It's not a love story for heaven sake,he is pathologically incapable of feeling so complex an emotion.
Except towards himself.
She wastes a significant proportion of her life waiting for him to change into a completely different person then,quite inexplicably decides she'll take him on as he is.Maybe she is hearing her biological clock.ticking.
Whatever,she dumps her French jazz pianist boyfriend so quickly he hardly has time to learn the melodic minor scale.
The device on which ""One Day"" hangs is so flimsy I lost interest very early on.
It might have been more winning if the writer had made the ""One Day"" the 29th February - at least it would have been over sooner.
All you need to know about the characters is that they play the terribly posh game ""Are you there,Moriarty"",an Oxbridge version of Blind Man's Buff with added violence .
Under the guise of which the seriously unpleasant guy smacks his girlfriend very hard in the face with a rolled up newspaper,causing her nose to bleed.
She(the lovely Romelai Garai - by far the best performance)still marries him and has his baby.
Well,I never said they were clever.",NA,"25 February 2018"
"chaz-28","There is a lingering and persistent distraction throughout One Day which severely impairs the audience from becoming absorbed in the film. This is Anne Hathaway's atrocious accent. Many Americans have at varying degrees in the past successfully pulled off a believable British accent. However, Anne Hathaway's character, Emma Morley, sounds at different times Irish, Scottish, and American, but never British. It truly was irritating after awhile. Why didn't the filmmakers just cast a British actress? Or, if they were dead set on Hathaway playing Emma, then move the whole story to America. If not for the distracting aural miscues, this film would most likely be much more enjoyable.Emma and Dexter (Jim Sturgess) meet the night of college graduation at the tail end of an all night party. This is not a meet-cute either. They are the only two left as the last couple pairs off with each other; therefore, fate has thrown them together to have a one night stand. Things get in the way and they end up deciding to be friends and start a very long platonic relationship. This is mostly convincing as Emma is seen to be truly infatuated with Dexter who does not see her in the same light, in fact, he treats her rather poorly as the years go by. Graduation night was July 15th by the way so naturally the pair concocts a plan to meet up annually on that day or at least check in my telephone if this is not possible.Surprisingly, every July 15th is actually a pretty horrible, sad day for each of them. Very rarely is one or both of them in a good mood and happy with where their life is at when the film jumps forward to another July 15th. Furthermore, the film focuses much more on Dexter than Emma with extensive scenes concerning his alcoholism and career missteps. Emma even authors a successful book and it hardly gets a mention until Dexter happens upon it. This made me wonder that if Dexter was to have so much more attention and screen time than Emma, why all the fuss to make Anne Hathaway British? Since the screenplay was written by the same gentlemen who wrote the novel this film is based on, the story's climax is inevitable even though it is forced and manipulative. The scene is also very poorly shot. The director, Lone Scherfig, who made the brilliant An Education two years ago, completely misses the mark with this scene and the rest of the film suffers for it. The event is set up in a way that even people who venture out and see one movie a year will be able to see what is coming up.Another miscue is Patricia Clarkson's role as Dexter's mother. It feels her role has been severely cut during the editing process. Not only does she have dialogue in the preview which is not in the movie, but she only shows up in about two-three scenes, moves the plot along, and then she's out of there. I have not read the novel, but I guarantee she is a much larger presence on those pages than what seems to be a faint echo of her in this movie.P.S. There is an atrocious Elvis Costello song over the closing credits which destroys any lingering fondness or afterthoughts the audience may have been enjoying during the closing scenes.",NA,"24 August 2011"
"Ali_John_Catterall","Yes, entirely predictably (well, you probably guessed as much from the trailer), they made an utter pig's ear of it. The Good:As Dex, Jim Sturgess is decent - nails the look, and the accent (both of them). Rafe Spall, as hapless wannabe comedian Ian is also fine - although there isn't a scintilla of genuine anguish about him when he's dumped, but hey, it's not his story right? (To be honest, it's a wonder they didn't simply represent him with a balloon on a stick.)It does have a few reflective moments of stillness, which are incredibly welcome - mostly concerning Dex and family (if the book was arguably slanted more towards Emma's side of the story, here it favours Dex) - but they're all too rare.The Bad:All too rare, because this one zips along like it's left the iron on (no mean feat in an 108 minute movie), galloping toward the denouement so that any emotional investment we might have made in it is almost completely wiped out. 1997, for example, literally lasts a swimming pool length. I know book-to-film adaptations bowdlerise to an extent, but this is absolutely ridiculous. There's also an argument to be made about the wisdom of letting writers adapt their own screenplays. Perhaps some sense of objectivity is lost in the process. Oddly enough, a previous David Nicholls' TV mini-series called 'I Saw You', starring Fay Ripley, is practically a warm-up for One Day, and is absolutely wonderful - very worth tracking down. That was in three parts. If the makers of One Day hadn't been so concerned with making a quick buck (usual story), this would have benefited from a mini-series of its own. But then, of course, there's no money in Telly.At its worst, the film's truncation manifests in a reliance on phone calls between the pair, which makes it seem as if Sturgess is frankly *stalking* Anne Hathaway. *That* twist, at least, is intact, and somewhat shocking. But in the same way a sudden glimpse of a mink being flayed alive in the middle of a Disney cartoon might be.Couldn't they have found one single British actress for crying out loud? Yes, I know only too well about the need for overseas investment. But you're not looking at Anne Hathaway thinking, 'working-class Northener' you're distractedly thinking, 'Isn't that... Anne Hathaway, working in a Tex Mex restaurant in Camden?'Romola Garai, who plays Sophie, would have done better - dressed-down a bit. (Or as often suggested, Carey Mulligan.) And how do they pull off Hathaway being only subtly attractive? Oversize specs. Because, you know, specs always make people look *dowdy*, apparently. I'm not even going to talk about her accent. You've heard it. It ranges from Angela's Ashes to... well, to Hathaway's own American accent, in fact.The Ugly:The more I think about this, the crosser I get. Film Emma never has any tawdry affairs, as in the novel, as it wouldn't suit her martyred character - and it wouldn't suit the fragrant Hathaway. A layered, interesting character becomes a 2-dimensional pouter; pure and nun-like. Just waiting around for Dexter to be ready, waiting for him to finally come around, and save her tormented soul. It's repulsive, actually - and *totally* a betrayal of her character and the spirit of the original. In short, it's not the very worst film in the world - it's just completely and utterly unremarkable; Sub-Richard Curtis, which is something this lovely and moving book just isn't.",NA,"19 August 2011"
"sdebord3136","I was pleasantly surprised by this film. I thought this was going to be another chick flick with a guy flirting with a girl but I found it was an amazing love story that spans 2 decades and gives a glimpse of what true love could really be. Anne H. was great for this because she is a timeless beauty that played her role through the years wonderfully, and Jim S. did a great job evolving with his character through immaturity to understanding. The European setting was beautiful and added to the scenes from the city to country side building the romance of it all.I wish I would have seen it sooner :)",NA,"20 November 2011"
"axxmy_one","People keep saying that movie adaptations from novels are usually not the same. Some are bad, some are okay, but in this case, it was beautiful. Lots of credit goes to David Nicholls for his excellent screenplay. Everything was PERFECT. Timeline, storyline and even the small details was well written. The acting was impeccable too. What about Anne Hathaway's accent? No problems there. Jim Sturgess plays the character Dexter perfectly. Most people would say that The Notebook is the top romantic teary eyed film. I tell them this: One Day is way better. It shows that two people can have friendship, loyalty, affection and love continuously. Watch it.

"juneebuggy","I was a huge fan of the book by David Nicholls and really looked foreword to seeing this... And while it didn't quite live up to my expectations and somewhat failed to capture the love and tragedy of the novel it was still a decent enough romance.The lovely Jim Sturgess plays rich playboy Dexter, with the (mostly irritating) Anne Hathaway as working class woman Em. We join them in 1988 on the night of their college graduation where they almost get together, decide to be friends and then proceed to follow them over the course of the next two decades.We see them through assorted relationships, phone calls, fights, hopes, vacations, missed opportunities, laughter and tears. There is always the anticipation of, will these two ever get together? The tone of the movie is different than the book, trying to be a bit like 'When Harry Met Sally' and failing. I also didn't ever feel the connection between Dexter and Em. I guess I should stop comparing the two, apples and oranges and all that but when you adore a book as much as I did its hard.The ageing of the characters is very well done here, subtle but especially apparent at the very end when the movie flips back to the night they met and you go wow, look how young they were. The clothing is also true to the decade and there are some fun (bad) hairstyles. 1/4/15",NA,"1 April 2015"
"neil-476","I give advance notice that I am going to be spoilering fairly extensively as this review goes on: you have been warned. Spoiler-free synopsis: Emma and Dexter meet on the day they graduate from university (July 15th 1988): there is an instant connection, and they nearly do the deed, but not quite. Instead, they enter into a long-term friendship which we, the audience, look in on every year on the anniversary of their meeting. Without giving anything away at this point, Emma becomes a waitress and would-be author who takes up with an unsuccessful stand-up comedian, and Dexter becomes a promiscuous TV presenter. We can see that that, ideally, they should be together because Emma desperately loves Dexter, and would be able to turn him from the louche, dissolute rake he has become into the decent man he has the potential to be. But, as the years go by, they always shy away from it. Anne Hathaway plays Emma and Jim Sturgess plays Dexter.Let me comment on a couple of points frequently mentioned elsewhere. One, I had no problem with Anne Hathaway's accent. It was, mostly, a tolerable all purpose moderately well-spoken British accent, with occasional ""oop north"" flattened vowels unnecessarily thrown in. It didn't distract me. Two, I understand that the book is a big hit with a chunk of the audience (the cinema audience was mostly older women in pairs, some with husbands dragged along. I was the only solo male). I haven't read the book, so I have no comment as to how well the film represented it.This film irritated me. I recognise that I am not part of the target demographic for a romantic drama, but I can be reached: my tear glands are perfectly prepared to well up in appropriate circumstances. However, I left the cinema dry-eyed and stony-faced: this film did not touch me in the slightest.I think I was irritated with it right from the start. A young man, subsequently shown to be highly promiscuous, ends up in bed with a girl who is ready and willing, and then - nothing happens? No, I don't think so. From then onwards I was constantly aware of the attempted pushing of emotional manipulation buttons, and it just didn't work. I thought the acting was fine, the period atmosphere good despite the odd anachronism, but I couldn't see why these two totally dissimilar people were soulmates, nor why they kept in touch, what she saw in him - in short, nothing about the emotional side of the film worked for me at all.OK, now I'm going to get really spoilery. And then, after donkeys' years go by, and things go pear shaped for him, Dexter finally learns a bit of humility by which time Emma has found herself a French jazz pianist. She instantly dumps the poor pianist and takes up with Dexter. While trying for a baby of their own (he already has a daughter by a previous relationship), she - really, I'm warning you, stop reading now if you don't want to hit a B.I.G. spoiler - is killed in a traffic accident. We then enter the final section of the film which attempts to have its cake and eat it. Intercut with each other we see Dexter coming to terms with life after Emma's death, in touching (but all not that touching!) conversations with his daughter and Emma's old stand-up comedian boyfriend, plus we see a kind of re-set button version of the day Dexter and Emma first got together which leads us towards the more satisfying relationship they could have had/did have (?) For all these years.And that irritated me even more.I was never uninterested in what went on, but I should have been moved by this film, and I wasn't - and I think it is because it was full of emotional dishonesty from start to finish.",NA,"26 August 2011"
"jmc4769","I just got back home from seeing this movie, and I feel like I've been hit upside the head with a baseball bat. I'm a sucker for romantic movies, and I've sat through hundreds of mediocre ones that were watchable anyway. But One Day had to be one of the worst romance movies I have ever had the misfortune to endure. It was especially disappointing because I've loved Anne Hathaway in just about everything she's been in (Princess Diaries, Ella Enchanted, Rachel Getting Married, The Devil Wears Prada, Rio, etc.). One Day has few redeeming qualities, except for the occasional pretty scenery. The most serious problem is Jim Sturgess's character, Dexter. Dexter is an unlikable, shallow womanizer. I know what you're thinking: Charming womanizers are a staple of these movies. But Sturgess gives Dexter no charm, no glimmer of humanity, no hint that there may be lovable qualities beneath his contemptible persona. The usually wonderful Hathaway (Emma) gets mired down here in a bad script. And there is not the tiniest spark of chemistry between the two. I kept thinking, ""Come on, Emma, block this loser's number and take out a restraining order."" When the inevitable romance comes, it hasn't a shred of believability. This movie ultimately amounts to a plain Jane wish-fulfillment fantasy (yep, Hathaway is supposed to be plain)...sort of like those movies where the nerdy guy gets the hot girl. The plot structure is a big problem too. We see the main characters only on one day (July 15th) of every year from 1988 to 2011. Instead of continuity, character development, and relationship development, we get mostly uninteresting snippets of their lives. The final straw for me though was the surprise ending, which was a completely gratuitous attempt to insert meaningful drama into an otherwise vacuous movie. At this point, I was begging for the movie to be over, but no such luck. Incredibly, screenwriter (and author of the book of the same name), David Nicholls, drags this bad movie out for another 15 minutes or so.",NA,"19 August 2011"

"achyutaghosh","Disclaimer first up- biased review, as I am a sucker for love stories.I used to think that Hollywood had stopped making emotionally involving love stories. Thank god they made One Day, then. Based on the best selling book by British author Dave Nicholls, the movie explores the intertwined lives of two protagonists of contrasting nature, yet fated to be together. The premise is novel, with the relationship explored though a peek into 15th July of each year, spread over 22 years. Good stories are brought to life by good acting, and here we have two superb exponents in lead roles- Jim Sturgess as Dexter and Anna Hathaway as Emma. Dexter leads the high profile life, a television anchor with success in all forms chasing him, always. But then his life is also hollow, his friends shallow, and in the end, a faces disillusionment and compromise. Emma dwells in obscurity mostly, but through sheer tenacity and belief achieves a modicum of success as a writer. They meet when they are 18, decide to remain lifelong friends, and they do remain so. In the meanwhile meandering through the vagaries of life, they are inexorably drawn towards each other, dependent on each other.Childhood sweethearts, even if long lost, when they do come together, they do get together without any questions asked- i say this having witnessed the same on a close friend of mine. And you cant help but fall in love with Emma and Dexter- their love story is so compelling and adorable, that you become a part of their story, you care for them, you laugh with them, and also cry, you want them to do what you would do, and yes, you desperately want a happy ending for them.And of course there is Anna Hathaway-suitably rumpled and grunge in the first half, and elegance and grace personified in the second, when she flashes her pearly whites, the world seems to be a better place to live.Why do people in love get to be in love in the best of locations? One Day happens in picturesque Edinburgh, colourful London, and stylish Paris. And the best thing that makes it stand out among all love stories is that it is not predictable, till the very end. People and things change with time, but memories remain the same.- here's a movie that raises a toast to happy memories, a Must watch for mushy folks!",NA,"23 November 2011"
"Philby-3","One Day Two eighties graduates in Edinburgh have an encounter on graduation day, July 15th ; the film follows their relationship by annual updates. Dexter (Jim Sturgess) brilliant, charismatic and a total narcissist and Emma (Ann Hathaway), a demure, warm sort are not a great match and both hitch up with others, but their friendship endures.The film is romantic, but only to a point, and can hardly be described as a comedy; there is too much pain for that, despite some funny dialogue. It is a kind of growing older movie – early promise turning sour, bright young ambitious things tasting failure and settling for something less. The story is cleverly told and nicely shot, with good support from Ken Stott and Patricia Clarkson as Dexter's disapproving parents and Rhys Spall as Emma's husband. Jim Sturgess looks and acts uncannily like a younger Rupert Graves, who has portrayed a long line of charming handsome wastrels. Ann Hathaway might be from New York but she plays Emma perfectly – the dialect coaches really earned their money. Both of the principals manage to evoke our sympathy, though Sturgess has the harder job.July 15 is St Swithin's day. On that day in 1415 the English Army led by Henry V (alias Laurence Olivier or Kenneth Branagh) defeated a larger French force at Agincourt. This has absolutely nothing to do with the movie though Dexter and Emma do at one stage venture to Brittany, where they manage to lose their clothes in one of the film's more comedic moments.I couldn't help feeling the story arc was rather predictable but I was absorbed nonetheless. At the end I'm not sure what the attraction was for Emma – she was smart enough to realise Dexter was a jerk but somehow she couldn't resist. He does get better – perhaps deep down she wanted to reform him. Or perhaps deep down she wanted to be a bit wild too.

"napierslogs","""One Day"", based on the novel of the same name, is the relationship of two people, Emma (Anne Hathaway) and Dexter (Jim Sturgess), as we see it on July 15th of each year. As can be expected from the nature of the story, it's a little dry, lacking in comedy. But then again, it's a romantic drama, not a romantic comedy.As is the nature of the two media, movies can never be exactly the same as the novel. But the problem with this one is that they tried to; no story lines were removed. Almost everything was there, just shortened into mostly meaningless segments. I personally could have done with one less event in their lives, and perhaps a different ending, but they tried to be as faithful as possible.What we have here is a movie about a relationship, but the novel was about the people. They traded in character depth and development so we can see them in their more attractive years falling in and out of love.I wasn't very familiar with Jim Sturgess, having seen him play skinny, slightly nerdy, not as confident kids. Dexter is a different breed of guy. Just has high on self-confidence as he is on drugs and alcohol, he gets by on his looks – literally – he's a TV host. Although the different characteristics of Dexter weren't explicitly shown in the movie, Sturgess brought them out in him perfectly. Emma is a more complex character, with significant evolution to who she is throughout the years, except none of that is in the movie, so it just wasn't really possible for Hathaway to portray her as a more interesting person.I would assume that watching ""One Day"" without the benefit of having read the novel would be a fairly confusing, empty experience. With the background that the novel gave me, I could fill in all the missing years and the unexplored layers to the characters, so there was still something to their relationship for me.",NA,"19 August 2011"
"TheBobbyjames","Very seldom in Hollywood are movies produced that are as emotionally involving as 'One Day.' It's a beautiful, beautiful love story of two people, Emma (Anne Hathaway) and Dex (Jim Sturgess). After spending the night together after graduation, we are taken on a journey into their lives for one day each year after they met; to see where they are or where they're not. Based on the book by David Nicholls (who also wrote the screenplay), 'One Day' transitions from novel to film brilliantly.First let me say film acting is what I believe makes or breaks a movie - if the actors are great, the movie is generally great. That's not to take away from any other element of film at all, but when everything else is done so well, if the acting were bad, the film would have been less memorable. But Anne Hathaway and Jim Sturgess are so very impressive here. They make their characters real and relatable, which are two key things every actor internally wishes they could do. In fact, as an on-screen pair, they work extremely well, together they exude chemistry.What I found most interesting about the entire experience was that I cared so much. I became enamoured with their lives. I kept hoping for the best. I anticipated what would happen to each of them. I sat forward, sat backward. I laughed and I cried. I've said many times before, a great movie will effect you emotionally in more ways than one. You'll be angry, you'll be happy, you'll be sad - the key is that you emote. This movie presented all of those elements. It was fresh and witty and everything you hope a movie will be. It's as beautifully made as it is acted and the locations are exquisite. Far too often, characters in Hollywood seem contrived and are not genuine. 'One Day' is honestly one of the most genuine stories ever told - there is no instant gratification, there is however frustration and that is the beauty of it all. It explores love and love lost, it explores friendship and the constraints of time and distance. It explores each character's journey to happiness and the trials they face along the way. So many little pieces of the puzzle are filled in between the years by simple, single lines of dialogue or actions. It's not the typical script of ""everything's all good-obstacle-everything ends well"" - there's a lot more complexity which makes it realistically genuine.So many little details, like eye-lines, smiles, sighs, cut-off conversations, etc. were paid attention to. The costuming, cinematography and score were spot on and all noteworthy. All of it combined was moving and awe-inspiring. I left the theater crying, but it didn't stop there, even thinking about the movie and those characters is deeply affecting. Maybe there are some underlying themes in the film that I'm identifying with, or maybe, just maybe the actors were really that great. Whatever it is, this film comes with my highest recommendation, is rated PG-13 and runs 107 minutes.",NA,"31 August 2011"
"TheLittleSongbird","The book was a wonderful read. One Day was a movie I was looking forward to, and while it was disappointing I found it very pleasant.What made the book so good and such a joy to read was not just the emotional impact, modern angst and characterisation but also how nostalgic it made me. The emotional impact and angst is here in the movie, what wasn't quite there was the nostalgia-evidence of it but could've been more- and characterisation which does feel choppy especially with Patricia Clarkson's Alison though Dexter is well realised.That said, I loved the beautiful look of the film, the soundtrack which gave the film its sense of nostalgia and the witty banter between Sturgess and Hathaway. The romantic elements are touching though the comedic elements don't always work coming across as a tad contrived. The direction is decent, the telling of the story is well paced(if somewhat glacial) and faithful and the script has some nice touches but also some weak ones. Of the support performances I thought Rafe Spall, Romola Garai and Ken Stott were the most effective and Clarkson was good if deserving of more to do. The picture belongs to Jim Sturgess, while staying true to his bad boy character of Dexter he also manages to be sympathetic.My feelings on Anne Hathaway were mixed. I loved her radiance and her chemistry with Sturgess, but her accent was inconsistent and felt forced and unnatural whenever she tried it. The shock ending also felt more bewildering than anything else, not the actual tragedy itself but rather the flashbacks that succeeded that I wasn't sure was really needed.In conclusion, pleasant if not entirely successful. 6.5/10 Bethany Cox",NA,"31 August 2011"
"JimmyCollins","Words cannot describe how wonderful an actress Anne Hathaway is, and in One Day she is in fine form, if there ever was an actress to go down in the history books among the greats it would be her. Jim Sturgess is quite a charming devil swell.The story that takes place in One Day is at moments the anti love story and other times a sweeping epic romance, even though this movie has been adapted from a book it's still a lot more original than other romantic themed films of late. Lone Scherfig definitely suits this style of English romance, starting with An Education and now this, it may sound mean but I just don't think the romantic dramas that come from the U.S have the same genuine feel that the English films do.I had read the book and i have to say that this is a very loyal adaptation, much of the beauty from the book is clear and present here, particularly the friendship aspect between Dex and Emma, in the book it's a quirky kind of friendship and it transferred well on the screen as, I was very pleased that the film makers didn't ruin that with a cheap silly sexual type of friendship.I could say a lot about how lovely this movie is but I think I'll let everyone make up their own mind. A lot of people have a bad opinion of this movie which I find baffling but I suppose each to their own, I just got totally wrapped up in this gorgeous romance.10 out of 10",NA,"3 September 2011"
"queen_of_naboo88","I went to see One Day last night, and though I had been looking forward to it for a while, I was surprised at how good it actually is. The film has a very unique atmosphere, as it is much quirkier than your average romance. Also, without giving away the ending, I can say that it isn't as predictable as one might think. What I really liked about it was the complexity of the different human relationships that we are shown. The relationship between Emma and Dexter is by no means an easy one, nor is it one-sided. Given how different they are, there is a lot of conflict between them, although they do love each other. Similarly, what Dexter and his ex-wife feel for one another is never pure hatred, but there is a lot of understanding between them. As a consequence, the story seems like it could be taken from real life. Plus, both Hathaway and Sturgess are as convincing as always, which makes this film absolutely worth seeing.",NA,"19 August 2011"
"guest_pabby","After perusing other reviews for this movie, I believe that many of the ratings are low, not because viewers disliked the movie, but because they disliked the element in which the film shines. The film succeeds in drawing the audience into the friendship between the main characters, played by Jim Sturgess and Anne Hathaway. Both characters find happiness and meaning in parts of their lives, while suffering through other portions without attaining goals they've set for themselves; i.e., this is real life.What the poorly-rating reviewers seek is escapism. In my view--however limited--this film aims to depict two human beings as they learn, grow, and fall in and out of touch with one another. Thus, don't expect any fairy tales here and don't punish the rating on this movie because it isn't a fairy tale! A predictable conclusion to this movie would place Sturgess and Hathaway side by side, married, and living together untouched by the trials of a realistic relationship. Instead, the director effectively and with calculation showcases some of life in the scenes and merely hints at events not shown on the screen. As the film narrates exclusively through one date each year (hence, the name), partial narratives are expected. The final third of the film, shunned by a few reviewers, elevated the creative vision of the story because it introduces the unpredictable nature of real life into a movie that was otherwise a run-of-the-mill romance. Again, speaking in terms of the development between characters, the movie is above average. Speaking in terms of storyline, the first two-thirds, to a certain degree, lack what the final third delivers: surprise! The juxtaposition of the present with the past near the end of this film makes the events even more potent than they would have been. Audience members who do not fall into the ""half-wit"" category can follow the story, regardless of what the viewers who read the novel state in their reviews. Bravo! Lastly, Anne Hathaway is exceedingly lovely.",NA,"3 September 2011"
"ferguson-6","Greetings again from the darkness. I have not read David Nicholls' novel, but my understanding is that it is extremely well written and its loyal readers really connected with Emma and Dexter. If that's true, then this film version is even worse than I thought while watching.This literally is my least favorite type of movie. A movie that assumes its viewers are unable to think for themselves or judge the actions of its characters. In other words, the filmmakers take for granted that we will accept whatever is shown on the big screen.First let me say that I completely understand the school girl crush that a young Emma (Anne Hathaway) has on her classmate Dexter (Jim Sturgess). He is handsome and charismatic and comes from more money than she. I also understand Dexter's attraction to the lovely Emma. She is very pretty - despite the ridiculous over-sized glasses for the early scenes - and very intelligent, and a significantly nicer person than he.What makes absolutely no sense to me is her continued attraction to this drunken, empty soul for the next twenty years. She is too smart to pine away the years hoping he will wise up and coming running to her. We are supposed to believe that she has no interest in any other relationship other than the non-threatening one with flopping stand-up comedian Ian (played by Timothy Spall's son Rafe) and a ""boring"" French Jazz Pianist.Dexter's mother is played by Patricia Clarkson. As she is dying from cancer, she tells him that she believes he will grow into a good man, but isn't there yet. I guess we are supposed to take her word for it. Instead we only see Dexter go from a selfish pig as a TV personality to a defeated man who must perform manual labor for the first time in his life. My issue is that a defeated man is not necessarily a good man. A man resigned to his life has not necessarily reached enlightenment. Where is Emma's proof that he deserves her? Where is the indication that her life with him will be better? I tell you where ... in the mind of that school girl from years ago.Please don't mistake my words as that of one who has no faith in romantic stories. There are so many ways this story could have turned that it would have had me. Instead it chose a path that assumed I was ignorant ... totally accepting of ridiculous story being laid out for me.My final comments on the film involve the cast. Anne Hathaway is an incredibly talented performer. She is not, however, British. Her accent is terribly distracting. Jim Sturgess is a handsome guy, but just not charismatic enough to pull off the TV personality role. Patricia Clarkson is a fantastic actress, but she is not British either. Seriously, are there not enough British actresses? The casting smells like a money-grubbing production team. As for director Lone Scherfig ... her previous film An Education was cinematic excellence. This is an unacceptable follow-up and we expect better next time.I will say the locations of Edinburg, London and Paris were beautiful and different than we usually get from the movies. That provided the only real enjoyment from this highly disappointing movie.",NA,"21 August 2011"
"Rob-O-Cop","this had some great aspects to it but ultimately failed to deliver. Firstly the good. Brilliant locations, beautiful cinematography, Anne Hathaway delivers a good performance,The bad. The editor and the director failed to establish a believable connection between the two lead actors as to why they would form a lasting bond that would carry them over 20 years. We're given a hint of this at the end but that doesn't help or fix the rest of the movie, so that's the bad editing aspect of this. if this scene had been at the front it might have helped sell the movie. That that scene didn't really deliver the goods needed to make it believable is the directors mistake along with many of the other scenes that tips the scale against the characters. Too many scenes of Dexter being a jerk and not enough of him being in anyway lovable or charming, even though there was much amusement to be had in the jerk Dexter scenes they blew out the balance of his character and it wasn't till the end that we got to see him as anything less than a jerk, but by then it was too late and it didn't really do anything to alter the confusion of why Emma would have cared. I also didn't buy Jim Sturgess performance, although a lot of people think differently, he came across as a caricature rather than a character. People have criticised Anne Hathaway's accent and there's probably some weight to that but I personally didn't find it annoying once I thought what's going on with her accent as it fluctuated all over the show. That's a continuity and a direction flaw as much as it is her performance. After a few mins I put it in the multi-sourced accent file as many people have blended accents. Outside of that Anne's delivering some really good depth in her work so much so that we may one day forgive her for the princess diaries.",NA,"27 January 2012"
"francine-k","I had watched ""One Day"" yesterday and was beyond excited because I had read the novel by David Nicholls, which was fantastic. The movie base's around 2 people and their twenty years together, shown only through one day, July 15th. I thought the plot was unique and was a very realistic romance. Sometimes it takes people a lot to lose to realize what life is about, and how certain people are truly important to you. The movie was cute, funny, and quite sad at times. I thought Anne Hathaway did an okay job on the accent, to me it was odd at first but after a couple minutes I had gotten used to it. Her acting was great and you can really see her changing as the years progress. Jim Sturgess was great and in my opinion really portrayed Dexter the best as possible, with the arrogance and attitude exactly as I imagined Dexter would have. In my own opinion the movie was a great watch, was a romance that I had been dying for ever sense The Notebook. Finally a tear jerking but smile at the end movie, that really anyone can enjoy, if your looking for a romance movie.",NA,"20 August 2011"
"JohnDeSando","One Day is promoted as drama romance and not a rom com. On all three counts I would call it out anyway, for it is a melodramatic, episodic tale of two best friends in London, Emma (Anne Hathaway) and Dexter (Jim Sturgess), who flirt with love over a long period but play on the standard cliché that requires they eventually end up together, regardless how many marriages and children intervene.One Day has too many short episodes from college in the '80's until professional life in 2011, and each seems just a variation on another before it: boy gets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl back again, well, you know the routine. During all these little skirmishes Emma remains wholesome (no stretch for the perpetually cute Hathaway, reminding me of Sally Hawkins' Poppy in Mike Leigh's Happy Go Lucky. But without Hawkins' charisma).Dexter is a cad and Lothario almost all the way, making him unlikeable and difficult to gain our sympathy. His cavalier treatment of his mother (the ever-interesting Patricia Clarkson) and father (Ken Stott) adds to his surly persona. In addition, Sturgess needs a little coaching or better script if he wishes to catch up with the Ryans (Gosling and Reynolds) in the emerging leading-man lineup.Nowhere do I feel a real sexual heat, especially since in most of the film they are avowing to be just friends. Moreover in the numerous years/episodes I do not feel the intellectual and emotional connection that comes so naturally in Richard Linklater's Before Sunrise/Sunset series. Even director Lone Scherfig's Parisian scenes are vacant, poor cousins to Woody Allen's romantic City of Lights in Midnight in Paris.As an Anglophile, I usually can forgive many sins if a film gives me an adequate dose of the great city, but as with the Paris background, romance takes a holiday even from the cities.",NA,"23 August 2011"
"blanbrn","Over the summer I saw this film sure it's typical chick flick, still as a male I admire the beauty and sexy look of Anne Hathaway who I think is a brilliant actress. Plus I think she pulled the international accent off just fine in this film and as always her look is sharp and just fine. This is a love story that spans time with memories these moments touch you staying with you forever despite when an unexpected tragedy strikes.Set in England it involves a couple Em(Anne Hathaway) and Dexter(Jim Sturgess) and after this international couple graduates from college and meet and fall for one another on July 15, 1989. From every year on on this date it's considered an anniversary for this couple as the film shows the special moments that happened during the lives of both. As each year on the same day is highlighted you see that no matter what path their lives have taken love and memories draw them together.Overall this is a film of memory and everlasting love sadly an unexpected tragedy occurs, but still with memories Dexter will love Em forever as long as memories are around love can last forever. Probably not a great film but worth a watch for any Anne Hathaway fan.",NA,"10 October 2011"
"jeffallenhammer","Does life imitate art or does art imitate life? I'm one who tends to avoid the discussion entirely by saying ""both."" One Day is the most real (save a few accents) movie I've seen in a long time. It explores time and how it often slips away from us. Our hearts' desires are often decimated by bad timing, and the movie finds a variety of ways to demonstrate this. So in the case of One Day, art imitates life to the fullest, as we can all sympathize (if only a little) to crushed hopes and shattered dreams, though hopefully we eventually find our way.Anne Hathaway stars as insecure working-class woman Emma, who, for one reason or another is drawn to Dexter, (Jim Sturgess) a charming upper middle class man with a great amount of self-confidence. It may be hard to understand just what the two have on each other, but they are characters I'm familiar with. The woman who is way too into a man that's way too into himself, it happens and for the type, Dex is pretty likable. Em and Dex have nothing in common. But their opposite personalities do what a relationship should; make each other better. They are Yin and Yang, complementary opposites.An interesting technique used by One Day, is that we only get to see the events of a single day, July 15, for each of 20 plus years. Some of my peers have taken to calling this a gimmick. In a year where it seems every other film is either a sequel or a remake/reboot, (which critics and public alike have grown tired of) I feel fresh ideas should be applauded, even if it doesn't quite work. For me, however, it worked to perfection. Director Lone Scherfig (An Education) paints the picture of Em and Dex's up and down relationship with great finesse, never having too much happen on the date year to year. The filmmaker fills us in on what has taken place throughout each year, without conversations seeming inorganic. The cinematography is beautiful, especially a scene where our would-be lovers break all their rules by taking a dip at sunset. There's plenty of humor, joy, sadness, regret and a number of other emotions to be felt. I caution viewers that this isn't a romantic comedy, nor does it end like one. One Day is, however, easily one of the most heartfelt films of the year and should be celebrated for its bravery.",NA,"31 August 2011"
"fernandoschiavi","Based on David Nichols' bestseller, ""One Day"" is a more mature Nicholas Sparks version, but equally tearful and melodramatic. Based on a peculiar and intriguing narrative structure, which revisits the 15th of July in the lives of Dexter and Emma since 1988 over more than 20 years, the story focuses on the maturation of the relationship between its characters, fleeing the punctuality and immediacy that surrounds most novels. Ironically, this same artifice reveals the main weakness of the script - others will be seen in the following paragraphs - because the annual reunion with the characters does not hide the considerable loss of information that motivated sudden changes in the life and behavior of each one.Sensitively directed by the Danish Lone Scherfig (""Education""), who delicately builds the fluid dynamic between Dexter and Emma (Hathaway), One Day is skillful in establishing the passage of time also with the aid of an impeccable make-up job - and notice how Sturgess, in particular, goes from a smooth-faced, jovial boy to a weary middle-aged man with wrinkles and bags under his eyes, while Hathaway emerges chubby (but not exaggeratedly so) after working two years as a waitress in a Mexican restaurant, which is an interesting detail. Benefiting from a competent cast that creates equally complex secondary characters that help compose the journey of the main couple (worth mentioning Rafe Spall, son of Timothy, who transforms the aspiring comedian Ian into a man that is simultaneously pathetic and moving), the film fails here and there by investing in stereotyped characterizations, but still avoiding that they dominate the narrative - and if Dexter's father appears as the typical ""cold and critical father"", Ken Stott manages to make him softer through occasional hesitations that point out his internal effort to try to get closer to the child.Likewise, if Nicholls' dialogues are occasionally forced to appeal to exposition in order to clarify what happened to the characters in the previous year, this is balanced by the good construction of so many other lines (especially those spoken by Hathaway), which they display the cold irony typical of British humor (Emma at one point describes the restaurant where she works as a ""graveyard of ambitions""). As if that were not enough, the script also creates really sensitive interactions between those people, highlighting the brief and beautiful scene between Dexter and his mother, who, played by Patricia Clarkson, shows melancholy and love when telling her son that, even certain that he will be a good man, realizes that he ""isn't there yet"".The dialogues are a strong point of the script, also written by David Nicholls. They are fast, with intelligent insights and manage to perfectly translate the personality of each character and their relationships with each other. Even with silly jokes, like Dexter's mother in Paris saying to her son, ""look over there, Alain Delon"" ... or not, it's your father"", demonstrating how much she is in love with her husband. There are funny scenes too, like when Dexter plays the most famous scene of Spartacus with the dolls for his daughter. But no character is better translated by the dialogues than Emma, the shy girl, but extremely intelligent and sagacious. Each of her lines is a bit of her temperament, feeling, spontaneity.However, it is even in the construction of Dexter and Emma that ""One Day"" proves to be particularly efficient: while the boy quickly achieves professional success, the girl struggles for years trying to make her artistic aspirations viable - a situation that gradually reverses as that we perceive that the former lacks the intellectual, emotional and psychological content that sustains his career, while Emma, growing from suffering, reflection and the simple experience of life, gradually transforms herself into a mature woman and ready to overcome the obstacles that previously prevented it from moving forward (and Sturgess and Hathaway, talented and charismatic, confidently illustrate these changes).The problem is that Hathaway's character quickly becomes the link with the audience. The dreamy sweetness, the sweetness and the detachment transform Emma into a very pleasant company, something that Dexter cannot see. Unsympathetic, self-centered and narcissistic, he uses Emma more as someone to quench the loneliness caused by her personality and assuage her pain and addictions than as a true friendship. Played by the expressionless Sturgess and his characteristic face of suffering, it is practically impossible to believe the beautiful and sensitive Emma fell in love with the guy after a disastrous dinner in which he exposes her (dis)interest. In this way, she emerges as the tragic anchor of the narrative, surrendering herself to the loves of a person she does not love, just to fill the sentimental need. What is revealed in the most cliché of sentences, enunciated according to the Nicholas Sparks booklet: ""she made him decent; you made her happy"".As Emma and Dexter mature, the adolescent, dreamy and inconsequential traits give way to realistic, cynical and disillusioned versions, propelled by tragedies, some of them approached with excessive disregard and disengagement due to the narrative structure - yet another negative effect of this. Elevated to the status of protagonist, an incorrect and questionable decision, Dexter undergoes a wide dramatic arc from his mother's illness (Clarkson), the cancellation of the television program, his marriage to Sylvie (Romola Garai, the young woman from ""Desire and Reparation"" and increasingly better actress), to an event that would definitely humanize him. At times, Emma's life is described in terms of her dream of becoming a writer or her relationship with Ian (Rafe Spall), which is disappointing.By scrutinizing and dissecting fractions of those characters' lives, certain moments should be more appropriately explored in David Nicholls' script. Dexter's firing after a botched interview and being hired on a video game show lacks a glimpse into the character's journey, though we understand what led to this precipitous fall. Similarly, Emma's relationship with Ian, presented at a dinner party without sparks or the guy's inability to make jokes, culminates in the explanation that she can't ""take him watching Wrath of Khan every day anymore"". This excessive exposition becomes constant in the film, requiring that a character needs to contextualize the events that are taking place to the public, which exposes the artificiality of the undertaking; well, if Emma and Dexter are such good friends, it was expected that he would reveal the bad news in the expected time and not months later.On the other hand, the annual narrative is well explored by Danish director Lone Scherfig, and the use of raccords and ellipses in Barney Pilling's montage stands out. And not just temporality, but the duo of characters allows Benoît Delhomme's photography to individualize Emma's trajectory in a nostalgic sepia, while Dexter is bathed in a depressing bluish color palette. Finally, Rachel Portman's score avoids being too intrusive, competently punctuating the narrative. Yes, the idea is curious and the narrative exercise valid (albeit flawed). The trajectory of two people is drawn before our eyes and, let's face it, it's not something usual in novel production. It is a pity, therefore, that the chosen 15th of July sounds hopelessly clichéd and expositional, making the unknown 364 remaining days of each year seem more interesting by comparison.We cannot, however, say that the film is not romantic. It has its moments, even if it prepares us to tears in such an obvious and brief way. Soon we will be in the next year, and the year after that, forgetting the pain and moving on. But that doesn't stop us from living in the moment. They are brief, it is true, but true and well-constructed. Especially in the final act, where we desperately want to go back to the beginning, as an attempt to remake the story, or at least fool our minds with that simple encounter in the middle of the street and a kiss seals the love story that should have been. Director Lone Scherfig managed to bring delicacy to the story of Emma and Dexter, making ""One Day"" a sensitive film. A love story built without resources common to films of this nature. Everything is almost realistic and fearful as life. She regrets that, when the situation picks up, she pulls the rug out from under us, with a cliché situation, announced, made just to make us cry. And she didn't even make it. Still, a good movie of its kind.",NA,"12 May 2023"
"Likes_Ninjas90","In the late 80s a girl named Emma (Anne Hathaway) is a college student who meets fellow graduate Dexter (Jim Sturgess). They're about to sleep together one evening but decide to remain friends instead. Over the course of twenty years we see how circumstances and other people have kept them divided when they just want to be together. Dexter finds himself hosting a ghastly television show, while being warned by his sick mother (Patricia Clarkson) that he isn't a particularly nice person anymore. He insists that he just wants to have fun, despite being critically panned and moving between women. Emma works her way up from a job in a fast food restaurant, to a teacher and then eventually into a successful author. To the distress of Dexter she has a serious relationship with an obnoxious comedian, which puts her real desires on hold. Late in the timeline, Dexter is married rather unhappily and has a baby girl to look after. An unlikeable leading man makes this one day too many. It's impossible to say what type of movie One Day is. It postures as a comedy but it barely raises a single laugh. And though it also lacks dramatic impact for much of its length too, its one climax is so shocking and over the top that it will leave a sour taste in your mouth. Do not consider this as a date movie. You will not be popular. You also have to wonder late in the movie what the point was. Director Lone Scherfig (An Education, 2009) tries to end things on a very syrupy note. That's very nice for one of the characters but unrewarding for the audience who have waded through twenty years in the lives of these unappealing characters for nothing. The message is ultimately a very obvious, unoriginal and simple one: that life pulls people in opposite directions but happiness can be found in one single moment. Using an extended chronological structure is a gimmick. It allows for little on screen titles to appear in the frame, just like in (500) Days of Summer (2009) but it refuses to enrich character. A film like Blue Valentine (2010) is infinitively more intelligent because it realises that character is structure. It contrasts the past and present day to visualise the changing personalities of its leads and the impact on their relationship. The script by David Nicholls, adapting his own novel, lacks this kind of sophistication. Having the film move through such an extensive period suggests that there will be arching transformations in the characters. But unfortunately Sturgess remains continuously unlikeable all throughout this movie. His character is arrogant, rude, promiscuous and irresponsible. And briefly touching on his fractured relationship with his parents does not make him anymore sympathetic. Patricia Clarkson is barely in this movie because she has so few scenes and I wasn't moved by her appearances as the film intended. One of the golden rules of the romantic comedy is broken here: you don't understand why Emma and Dexter belong together. This is a detriment to the film's plotting and the motives of the characters. We're left wondering what this apparently sophisticated woman continues to see in this buffoon, especially when she's already with better company. Even after that huge climax Dexter still has a moment of madness. Only at the very end does he wake up to himself. The actors aren't really to blame. Anne Hathaway is such a pleasant actress in almost everything she does, comedy or otherwise. But this sketchy, underwritten role wastes her talents and doesn't stretch her chops at all. She's made to look dorky and uptight with her over-sized glasses, only to move into little but quirkiness. And Jim Sturgess who I liked in Across the Universe (2007) and The Way Back (2010) is gifted too, with no shortage of personality. He just happens to be playing a real jerk. If that's what he intended, he certainly succeeded. As far as the rebirth of frank romantic-comedies goes this is a pretty uninspired and limp entry.",NA,"24 August 2011"
"ianlouisiana","Here in the UK we call people like this ""Up themselves""and I can't think of a film where that description of the characters is more applicable.
One frankly poisonous bloke with his brains in his pants tries for 20 - odd years to seduce a girl he was at university with.
That,basically,is what ""One Day"" is all about.
It's not a love story for heaven sake,he is pathologically incapable of feeling so complex an emotion.
Except towards himself.
She wastes a significant proportion of her life waiting for him to change into a completely different person then,quite inexplicably decides she'll take him on as he is.Maybe she is hearing her biological clock.ticking.
Whatever,she dumps her French jazz pianist boyfriend so quickly he hardly has time to learn the melodic minor scale.
The device on which ""One Day"" hangs is so flimsy I lost interest very early on.
It might have been more winning if the writer had made the ""One Day"" the 29th February - at least it would have been over sooner.
All you need to know about the characters is that they play the terribly posh game ""Are you there,Moriarty"",an Oxbridge version of Blind Man's Buff with added violence .
Under the guise of which the seriously unpleasant guy smacks his girlfriend very hard in the face with a rolled up newspaper,causing her nose to bleed.
She(the lovely Romelai Garai - by far the best performance)still marries him and has his baby.

"chaz-28","There is a lingering and persistent distraction throughout One Day which severely impairs the audience from becoming absorbed in the film. This is Anne Hathaway's atrocious accent. Many Americans have at varying degrees in the past successfully pulled off a believable British accent. However, Anne Hathaway's character, Emma Morley, sounds at different times Irish, Scottish, and American, but never British. It truly was irritating after awhile. Why didn't the filmmakers just cast a British actress? Or, if they were dead set on Hathaway playing Emma, then move the whole story to America. If not for the distracting aural miscues, this film would most likely be much more enjoyable.Emma and Dexter (Jim Sturgess) meet the night of college graduation at the tail end of an all night party. This is not a meet-cute either. They are the only two left as the last couple pairs off with each other; therefore, fate has thrown them together to have a one night stand. Things get in the way and they end up deciding to be friends and start a very long platonic relationship. This is mostly convincing as Emma is seen to be truly infatuated with Dexter who does not see her in the same light, in fact, he treats her rather poorly as the years go by. Graduation night was July 15th by the way so naturally the pair concocts a plan to meet up annually on that day or at least check in my telephone if this is not possible.Surprisingly, every July 15th is actually a pretty horrible, sad day for each of them. Very rarely is one or both of them in a good mood and happy with where their life is at when the film jumps forward to another July 15th. Furthermore, the film focuses much more on Dexter than Emma with extensive scenes concerning his alcoholism and career missteps. Emma even authors a successful book and it hardly gets a mention until Dexter happens upon it. This made me wonder that if Dexter was to have so much more attention and screen time than Emma, why all the fuss to make Anne Hathaway British? Since the screenplay was written by the same gentlemen who wrote the novel this film is based on, the story's climax is inevitable even though it is forced and manipulative. The scene is also very poorly shot. The director, Lone Scherfig, who made the brilliant An Education two years ago, completely misses the mark with this scene and the rest of the film suffers for it. The event is set up in a way that even people who venture out and see one movie a year will be able to see what is coming up.Another miscue is Patricia Clarkson's role as Dexter's mother. It feels her role has been severely cut during the editing process. Not only does she have dialogue in the preview which is not in the movie, but she only shows up in about two-three scenes, moves the plot along, and then she's out of there. I have not read the novel, but I guarantee she is a much larger presence on those pages than what seems to be a faint echo of her in this movie.P.S. There is an atrocious Elvis Costello song over the closing credits which destroys any lingering fondness or afterthoughts the audience may have been enjoying during the closing scenes.",NA,"24 August 2011"
"Ali_John_Catterall","Yes, entirely predictably (well, you probably guessed as much from the trailer), they made an utter pig's ear of it. The Good:As Dex, Jim Sturgess is decent - nails the look, and the accent (both of them). Rafe Spall, as hapless wannabe comedian Ian is also fine - although there isn't a scintilla of genuine anguish about him when he's dumped, but hey, it's not his story right? (To be honest, it's a wonder they didn't simply represent him with a balloon on a stick.)It does have a few reflective moments of stillness, which are incredibly welcome - mostly concerning Dex and family (if the book was arguably slanted more towards Emma's side of the story, here it favours Dex) - but they're all too rare.The Bad:All too rare, because this one zips along like it's left the iron on (no mean feat in an 108 minute movie), galloping toward the denouement so that any emotional investment we might have made in it is almost completely wiped out. 1997, for example, literally lasts a swimming pool length. I know book-to-film adaptations bowdlerise to an extent, but this is absolutely ridiculous. There's also an argument to be made about the wisdom of letting writers adapt their own screenplays. Perhaps some sense of objectivity is lost in the process. Oddly enough, a previous David Nicholls' TV mini-series called 'I Saw You', starring Fay Ripley, is practically a warm-up for One Day, and is absolutely wonderful - very worth tracking down. That was in three parts. If the makers of One Day hadn't been so concerned with making a quick buck (usual story), this would have benefited from a mini-series of its own. But then, of course, there's no money in Telly.At its worst, the film's truncation manifests in a reliance on phone calls between the pair, which makes it seem as if Sturgess is frankly *stalking* Anne Hathaway. *That* twist, at least, is intact, and somewhat shocking. But in the same way a sudden glimpse of a mink being flayed alive in the middle of a Disney cartoon might be.Couldn't they have found one single British actress for crying out loud? Yes, I know only too well about the need for overseas investment. But you're not looking at Anne Hathaway thinking, 'working-class Northener' you're distractedly thinking, 'Isn't that... Anne Hathaway, working in a Tex Mex restaurant in Camden?'Romola Garai, who plays Sophie, would have done better - dressed-down a bit. (Or as often suggested, Carey Mulligan.) And how do they pull off Hathaway being only subtly attractive? Oversize specs. Because, you know, specs always make people look *dowdy*, apparently. I'm not even going to talk about her accent. You've heard it. It ranges from Angela's Ashes to... well, to Hathaway's own American accent, in fact.The Ugly:The more I think about this, the crosser I get. Film Emma never has any tawdry affairs, as in the novel, as it wouldn't suit her martyred character - and it wouldn't suit the fragrant Hathaway. A layered, interesting character becomes a 2-dimensional pouter; pure and nun-like. Just waiting around for Dexter to be ready, waiting for him to finally come around, and save her tormented soul. It's repulsive, actually - and *totally* a betrayal of her character and the spirit of the original. In short, it's not the very worst film in the world - it's just completely and utterly unremarkable; Sub-Richard Curtis, which is something this lovely and moving book just isn't.",NA,"19 August 2011"
"sdebord3136","I was pleasantly surprised by this film. I thought this was going to be another chick flick with a guy flirting with a girl but I found it was an amazing love story that spans 2 decades and gives a glimpse of what true love could really be. Anne H. was great for this because she is a timeless beauty that played her role through the years wonderfully, and Jim S. did a great job evolving with his character through immaturity to understanding. The European setting was beautiful and added to the scenes from the city to country side building the romance of it all.I wish I would have seen it sooner :)",NA,"20 November 2011"
"axxmy_one","People keep saying that movie adaptations from novels are usually not the same. Some are bad, some are okay, but in this case, it was beautiful. Lots of credit goes to David Nicholls for his excellent screenplay. Everything was PERFECT. Timeline, storyline and even the small details was well written. The acting was impeccable too. What about Anne Hathaway's accent? No problems there. Jim Sturgess plays the character Dexter perfectly. Most people would say that The Notebook is the top romantic teary eyed film. I tell them this: One Day is way better. It shows that two people can have friendship, loyalty, affection and love continuously. Watch it. Whether you have read the book or not, you will fall in love with Dexter & Emma !",NA,"24 November 2011"
"juneebuggy","I was a huge fan of the book by David Nicholls and really looked foreword to seeing this... And while it didn't quite live up to my expectations and somewhat failed to capture the love and tragedy of the novel it was still a decent enough romance.The lovely Jim Sturgess plays rich playboy Dexter, with the (mostly irritating) Anne Hathaway as working class woman Em. We join them in 1988 on the night of their college graduation where they almost get together, decide to be friends and then proceed to follow them over the course of the next two decades.We see them through assorted relationships, phone calls, fights, hopes, vacations, missed opportunities, laughter and tears. There is always the anticipation of, will these two ever get together? The tone of the movie is different than the book, trying to be a bit like 'When Harry Met Sally' and failing. I also didn't ever feel the connection between Dexter and Em. I guess I should stop comparing the two, apples and oranges and all that but when you adore a book as much as I did its hard.The ageing of the characters is very well done here, subtle but especially apparent at the very end when the movie flips back to the night they met and you go wow, look how young they were. The clothing is also true to the decade and there are some fun (bad) hairstyles. 1/4/15",NA,"1 April 2015"
"neil-476","I give advance notice that I am going to be spoilering fairly extensively as this review goes on: you have been warned. Spoiler-free synopsis: Emma and Dexter meet on the day they graduate from university (July 15th 1988): there is an instant connection, and they nearly do the deed, but not quite. Instead, they enter into a long-term friendship which we, the audience, look in on every year on the anniversary of their meeting. Without giving anything away at this point, Emma becomes a waitress and would-be author who takes up with an unsuccessful stand-up comedian, and Dexter becomes a promiscuous TV presenter. We can see that that, ideally, they should be together because Emma desperately loves Dexter, and would be able to turn him from the louche, dissolute rake he has become into the decent man he has the potential to be. But, as the years go by, they always shy away from it. Anne Hathaway plays Emma and Jim Sturgess plays Dexter.Let me comment on a couple of points frequently mentioned elsewhere. One, I had no problem with Anne Hathaway's accent. It was, mostly, a tolerable all purpose moderately well-spoken British accent, with occasional ""oop north"" flattened vowels unnecessarily thrown in. It didn't distract me. Two, I understand that the book is a big hit with a chunk of the audience (the cinema audience was mostly older women in pairs, some with husbands dragged along. I was the only solo male). I haven't read the book, so I have no comment as to how well the film represented it.This film irritated me. I recognise that I am not part of the target demographic for a romantic drama, but I can be reached: my tear glands are perfectly prepared to well up in appropriate circumstances. However, I left the cinema dry-eyed and stony-faced: this film did not touch me in the slightest.I think I was irritated with it right from the start. A young man, subsequently shown to be highly promiscuous, ends up in bed with a girl who is ready and willing, and then - nothing happens? No, I don't think so. From then onwards I was constantly aware of the attempted pushing of emotional manipulation buttons, and it just didn't work. I thought the acting was fine, the period atmosphere good despite the odd anachronism, but I couldn't see why these two totally dissimilar people were soulmates, nor why they kept in touch, what she saw in him - in short, nothing about the emotional side of the film worked for me at all.OK, now I'm going to get really spoilery. And then, after donkeys' years go by, and things go pear shaped for him, Dexter finally learns a bit of humility by which time Emma has found herself a French jazz pianist. She instantly dumps the poor pianist and takes up with Dexter. While trying for a baby of their own (he already has a daughter by a previous relationship), she - really, I'm warning you, stop reading now if you don't want to hit a B.I.G. spoiler - is killed in a traffic accident. We then enter the final section of the film which attempts to have its cake and eat it. Intercut with each other we see Dexter coming to terms with life after Emma's death, in touching (but all not that touching!) conversations with his daughter and Emma's old stand-up comedian boyfriend, plus we see a kind of re-set button version of the day Dexter and Emma first got together which leads us towards the more satisfying relationship they could have had/did have (?) For all these years.And that irritated me even more.I was never uninterested in what went on, but I should have been moved by this film, and I wasn't - and I think it is because it was full of emotional dishonesty from start to finish.",NA,"26 August 2011"
"jmc4769","I just got back home from seeing this movie, and I feel like I've been hit upside the head with a baseball bat. I'm a sucker for romantic movies, and I've sat through hundreds of mediocre ones that were watchable anyway. But One Day had to be one of the worst romance movies I have ever had the misfortune to endure. It was especially disappointing because I've loved Anne Hathaway in just about everything she's been in (Princess Diaries, Ella Enchanted, Rachel Getting Married, The Devil Wears Prada, Rio, etc.). One Day has few redeeming qualities, except for the occasional pretty scenery. The most serious problem is Jim Sturgess's character, Dexter. Dexter is an unlikable, shallow womanizer. I know what you're thinking: Charming womanizers are a staple of these movies. But Sturgess gives Dexter no charm, no glimmer of humanity, no hint that there may be lovable qualities beneath his contemptible persona. The usually wonderful Hathaway (Emma) gets mired down here in a bad script. And there is not the tiniest spark of chemistry between the two. I kept thinking, ""Come on, Emma, block this loser's number and take out a restraining order."" When the inevitable romance comes, it hasn't a shred of believability. This movie ultimately amounts to a plain Jane wish-fulfillment fantasy (yep, Hathaway is supposed to be plain)...sort of like those movies where the nerdy guy gets the hot girl. The plot structure is a big problem too. We see the main characters only on one day (July 15th) of every year from 1988 to 2011. Instead of continuity, character development, and relationship development, we get mostly uninteresting snippets of their lives. The final straw for me though was the surprise ending, which was a completely gratuitous attempt to insert meaningful drama into an otherwise vacuous movie. At this point, I was begging for the movie to be over, but no such luck. Incredibly, screenwriter (and author of the book of the same name), David Nicholls, drags this bad movie out for another 15 minutes or so.",NA,"19 August 2011"
