"syntory","Look at the profiles for the writers that wrote Madame Web. You'll see virtually every movie they've written has a bad rating and bad reviews. Why then does Hollywood continually hire these same writers for these big budget films? I could understand if they wrote movies for Asylum Films because all their movies are terrible.Madame Web is god awful! Very difficult to sit through. None of the main characters are likeable. Even the villain is lame. It seems like the entire movie was written to set up a sequel. But why would people spend money to see the sequel of a movie that is one of the worst movies ever written? I'm shocked at how bad this movie is and if there is a sequel I certainly wont bother watching it.Stop hiring bad writers, Hollywood!","2","15 February 2024"
"MovieWarfare","I would absolutely love to be in these Sony meetings because I am absolutely baffled how things like Madame Web are getting greenlit.Madame Web is one of the worst superhero movies ever made! It has terrible writing, characters, action setpieces and even acting. Dakota Johnson is so dull and boring as the main lead but this is probably down to the terrible script.To be fair, the movie does have an interesting concept with this Final Destination x Terminator thing. However, it is so poorly executed that it makes Morbius look like The Dark Knight.Anyway give me the ""He Was in the Amazon With My Mom When She Was Researching Spiders Right Before She Died"" cut!","1","17 February 2024"
"chenp-54708","Literally one of the worst superhero movies I have ever seen.From the advertisements, I knew this movie wasn't going to be great but still, it surprised me how bad and boring it was. Everything about the direction, writing, characters, technical aspects, and designs are really awful. The writing is poor as there are many concepts, ideas and aspects that are messy and bland. The messy script creates poor dialogue from the cast and the characters are not interesting. The special effects looked even worse than the marketing and all of the performances were pretty bad. I honestly do feel bad for Dakota Johnson cause she is a good actress but she deserves to have better roles then this. It can be said for the same for the rest of the cast members.The uses of product placements are annoying, action moments are dull, and and all in all, it was boring. Superhero movies shouldn't be boring but this really dragged on. It's unfortunate cause female superhero leads are something I love to see more like Wonder Woman and The Old Guard which are pretty fun. But unfortunately, it seemed that it likely isn't going to happen anytime soon.There really isn't anything else to say.Bad.","1","14 February 2024"
"AlsExGal","... when I saw Dakota Johnson was starring in it. Naturally I can't lay the entirety of this hot mess at her feet. But there is some really bad campy acting happening on her part, reminiscent of the Fifty Shades of Grey movies in which she starred. Perhaps it was because the director was more interested in the placement of Pepsi cans than her performance, but I digress.Basically, this movie plays out like the cut scenes from a budget Xbox 360 game. From the ground up this thing just feels designed to fail. It feels almost Producersesque in its approach in just how every aspect is seemingly intentionally mangled, yet no one seems to care. How have we come so full circle to go through the glory of Infinity War/Logan/The Dark Knight to arrive all the way back to Batman and Robin and Catwoman levels of superhero flicks? (Bam!, Pow!, Gosh yes Batman!)How did this movie make it so far that it has an actual release, and no one stopped it? How did this idea get green lit? Why did Sony give 80 million and turn over their valuable IP to the people that wrote Morbius, Gods of Egypt, Dracula Untold and The Last Witch Hunter? How did this get past the writing process and again have that script greenlit? How could no one on the set at any point stop things? How did no one in the editing room point out how bad it looked and how much of a mess it was?But to the suits it's not about art and story. Instead it's about business, and people are just a commodity. It's cheaper to recycle known quantities, and practice nepotism and involve maybe less than talented friends, people you've worked with before, than go out and find artists with worthy stories. They don't care about art, they don't care about stories, they care about making this work for them financially, regardless of loss of reputation with audiences as a whole.Youtuber Chris Stuckmann did a deep dive on the topic of big studios being generally run by folks who came up through management rather than the creative rungs such as writing and directing when he discussed this film. His take is worth watching. For some reason, Chris doesn't do critical movie reviews since he has become a filmmaker, but I can tell by his tone that, like me, he was completely displeased watching this one. I'd avoid it.","2","17 February 2024"
"eoinageary","This is, well I guess this is a movie in the Sony universe that I'm SHOCKED is profitable.The story is all over the place, it's basically about Madame Web who is a paramedic and develops powers and can see into the future, with a current threat she tries to change the future, teaming up with 3 powerful characters who are yet to develop into their full potential so she must shield them and change the future to protect them.Trying not to give the little story that gets told away in the opening there but i have to be vague.What I liked, one or two good scenes, I didn't mind the end, I really liked a lot of the camera work some cool looking shots and a decent Score.But the movie is BAD, it makes Morbius look like The Batman 2022. The acting is lacking, the actors look as bored as you will feel. Script is bad, just some beyond silly lines, the story chops and changes so much your neck will hurt you, some bad CGI, and just boring action.And before people harp on about ""you don't like it because it's women leads"" no, it's just a crap film, I enjoyed the marvels, Black Widow was decent, so no, the movie regardless of its leads is just poor.Extremely disappointing, 3/10.","3","14 February 2024"
"tbunker-88294","I can honestly say that once again (not that anyone is surprised) that Sony has bombed again with its superhero content. Underwhelming action, bad characters, weird dialogue, generic villain. Its just plain badI feel bad for the cast of this movie, you have EXCELLENT talent and its just wasted in this cash grab excuse of a movieSony has proved once again it can't be trusted with superhero content and has lost what little credibility it had. If the company had any integrity or wits left they should sell their share of ownership back to Marvel and let them assume FULL creative control.I'm not optimistic for Kraven The Hunter after seeing this gross disappointment.","1","14 February 2024"
"hotrobinproductions","Horrible from beginning to end, the opening scene just reeks of awful predictability from story & plot to the core. You know exactly what will happen before it even happens, the script sucks & the dialogue is even worse. There is quite noticeable audio dub edited after the fact too. This budget is 80 million, not that budget matters, because no amount of money could have saved this train wreck, but I mention this because you can still make a good film on lower budgets, Shazam, the first one, had the same budget & delt with a lot of side characters too, it's miles better, Godzilla minus one had a extremely low budget too. But this 80 million dollar film not just effects but production, feels obviously cheap, it almost feels like watching a very long pilot episode to a CW tv show.You thought Morbius was bad, that film was bad because it did the bare minimum, this film doesn't even do the bare minimum, it goes beyond comprehension below that, it just enters a point of no originality or ambition towards creating anything. There isn't even a single superhero moment, even horrible films like catwoman or Morbius has superhero moments & action, this thing doesn't, you get instead visions of the future to potentially set up sequels.This movie also has a serious problem of product placement, it's a long commercial, to be exact a long Pepsi commercial, I feel like Pepsi stopped the halftime show so they could invest in the product placement in this film. This movie was more important to them than the superbowl LOL it's just so over the top & obviously placed way too much in this film. Calvin Klein, Chase bank, the list goes on. This movie should be called superhero product placement the movie.It's barely even close to a 1/10 the cool moments are seeing what we already saw in the trailer when she's seeing the future & you think it's happening now but then it goes back to the moment she realizes it's a vision, granted it's cool the first couple times but it gets old REAL quick. & it ends up getting annoying because it's abused way too much.Thats about it, there isn't any redeeming things in this film, the acting isn't even good. I would say the 3 side character spider women that Dakota finds when they are together there was a potential spark. I saw the talent & potential, but they are failed big time by such a horrid script that the spark never even sparks, it's just like showing you the matches & gasoline & not setting the fire.Madame M0RBIUS / 10.","1","16 February 2024"
"olcare","It's the worst movie and superhero adaptation I've watched in recent years. Completely atrocious effects, atrocious screenplay, and atrocious acting. Also, a big insult to all comic book readers and those who know the original story.Let me describe the movie simply. First of all, I am filled with hatred; I really want to curse the entire creative team for this unacceptable film.All the performances are bad, everyone. There's not a single good actor trying; everyone just took the role for money. It's a terrible disgrace, a total eclipse of reason.The screenplay is the worst superhero screenplay I've ever seen. It barely resembles the original story, and if there aren't scenes like the other Spider-Girls in the trailer, why include them? There's no such obligation; instead, write a decent screenplay. All action scenes are full of logical errors; they've written it without thinking, it's complete garbage.Apart from these, the direction, sorry to say, is garbage too. Most scenes are shot as if they were taken straight from a phone camera; action scenes are not shown, they're hidden due to the atrociousness of the effects. It's shameful.After these general points, Sony urgently needs to cancel this universe; the original stories are garbage, there's no logic, no connection anywhere. They're just being shot randomly. I don't like to curse, but I hope this film sinks at the box office.The last scene with Madame Web gaining her powers, those web effects, clinging to souls, it's unbelievable how you approved this film, may God punish you.I don't know which one to talk about; all the atrocities are collected in this film. Whether it's the woman going to Peru and back in 30 seconds, Spider-Man dodging with fireworks, dancing at the boys' table when my daughters are left alone, not telling the story of the Spider-Human community, or the woman talking normally while giving birth at the end, everything is a disgrace. I hope this universe sinks, and you all get fired. No one involved in the management of this film deserves their job respectfully; they should quit immediately.Note: Dakota Johnson made a statement saying she didn't watch the movie. Why are you serving a completely garbage film if you're not going to watch it? Life shouldn't be all about money for you; we, in our poverty, are trying to watch it, and this is no different from cursing all the audience's families. Shame on you.Note 2: Just now, I looked at the budget of the movie, and my anger grew even more, 80 million dollars EIGHTY MILLION. How can I not believe this money, I really can't believe it, it's nothing but disrespect to yourself, disrespect to the audience, nothing but an insult.","1","16 February 2024"
"sinscopefilms","First Impression:The opening of the Madame Web was immersed in a mystique and ambition, enhanced by great musical score; yet, as the movie progresses, it becomes a mixed bag and a rollercoaster of emotions.The Positive:Musical Score and Sound Design: The standout feature of ""Madame Web"" is its musical score. The soundtrack not only enhances the emotional depth of the film but also succeeds in creating in some moments genuine goosebumps. The sound design really enhances this impact by carefully using sound pans, bass, and reverse effects. It creates a sense of tension and immersion which is one of the film's strongest features.The Mixed:Visual Effects and Costume Design: Some of the visual effects in ""Madame Web"" were visually appealing. The costume design, like Casey's red jacket and the three spider girl villain outfits standing out as particularly stunning contributions to the film's aesthetic, but it was not often shown in the film since the films direction and focus was different. I was disappointed.Acting and Direction: Although I thought Casey's character development - her ability to see the world from a different perspective - was great, I didn't like how it was visually presented. The way it was edited was poorly done. The editor could use 2 distinct color grading features where one sees the future and two, she sees the present moment.However, The performances throughout the film feel lackluster, with the actors appearing confused and disengaged. This, combined with direction that fails to maintain interest or coherence in many scenes, significantly undermines the film's potential.Negatives:Cinematography: Cinematography is bad since some pictures don't show a clear image. The camera moves so fast that I cannot comprehend the picture. I kind of recognized that it tries to initiate the rapidness of the events from the spider's eye point of view but it was a tasteless decision. The Cinematography is not something like wow. The reason why Cinematography was lacking is because it was heavily based on medium closeups and dutch tilts which on one hand was a unique choice but on the other hand very hard to watch. I found the 180 degree round camera rotations super cool, but again, I expected varied distance shots, not just medium shots. The train scene Cinematography was the best in the film.Editing and Pace: The editing is arguably the weakest element of ""Madame Web,"" with its rapid cuts and disjointed flow detracting significantly from the storytelling. This lack of coherence makes it challenging for the audience to fully engage with the narrative.Plot and Overall Execution: The storyline of ""Madame Web"" is cluttered and clichéd, suffering from a lack of originality and clear direction. The film's ambition is evident, but the execution falls short of creating a compelling narrative.The Conclusion:""Madame Web"" presents a paradoxical experience, with exceptional music and sound design standing that sharply contrasts with its various flaws in editing, cinematography, and direction.Although there are some visually and emotionally stunning moments, they are frequently overshadowed by a lack of coherence and clarity.Also, I think this film would be reasonable and great to be incorporated in a TV series which would have allowed for a more in-depth exploration of characters and plot.Nevertheless, Madame Web is a bit of a mixed bag, with moments of potential that ultimately leave the viewer something different visually.Rating: 3/10.","3","15 February 2024"
"Skruffbagg","Cannon, is that you in disguise?I firmly believe Madame Web will go down in history as not only the worst superhero movie, but also one of the worst movies ever made. It's that bad. It's absolutely fascinating to behold.Now, I'll be honest with you here. I only went to see this because I had heard it was an unmitigated disaster that had to be seen to be believed, and it truly does not disappoint - or massively does, depending on your viewpoint.It takes a special kind of director to get such cringe-inducing performances out of a fairly talented cast (Dakota Johnson and Tahar Rahim are both quality actors with the right script and direction), but SJ Clarkson somehow manages to wrangle the absolute worst imaginable from every single person in the film. I'll be very surprised if she ever does another feature after this.Nothing in this film works; the plot is moronic, the script seems like it was written by a teenager, the cinematography is horrendous, the aformentioned embarrassing performances, the audio editing is baffling (so much dubbing, brain-melting music choices). I'm amazed this didn't get shelved the minute the final cut was done.To me, I rate this as ""so bad it's good"" as I wasn't bored watching it, but most people I assume will say it's just plain bad... and it is, but very entertainingly so.If you love watching a 2hr car crash then I highly recommend this. The awfulness is mind-boggling in it's complexity, but in the best possible way. Film scholars and historians will be analysing this movie for years to come, and I hope it is talked about in the same vein as The Room in the future.An absolutely epic misfire on all levels.","1","20 February 2024"
"MiroslavKyuranov","It's astonishing to think that Sony could put out a worse product than 2022's Morbius, but boy, ""Madame Web"" manages it. It is an embarrassing mess. Talented stars wasted on probably one of the worst comic book movie ever (which nobody asked for). Filled with atrocious dialogue, awkward editing and laughable structure. It's a clunky, poorly-written, messy, and sloppy movie packed with some mediocre editing and performances.The concept is interesting on paper, but it couldn't be saved due to it's terrible execution. ""Madame Web"" simply lacked the spark it needed in nearly every dept.There is simply nothing memorable in this movie, except maybe some superhero costumes, but that doesn't redeem the fact that the movie is bad.So yeah...""Madame Web"" is yet another disappointing entry in the Sony's Spider-Less universe. It's like a love letter to an era of superhero films that people largely want to forget. The ""Pepsi"" adds are stand-out, it falls short of what could have been a decent movie in the hands of someone else twenty years ago.","4","14 February 2024"
"darrelltill","There is nothing good in this film. It's badly written - not just full of clichés but full of dialogue that is meant to sound like cliché superhero idioms yet butchered until they make no sense. It is nothing but a costume parade with players that are dead behind the eyes. You can tell that everybody involved knows it's going to be a stinker but they'd already signed on and it was too late. It would be great if this was the flop that made Disney rethink their output (I know, this is actually an SSU movie not an MCU movie, but they are all heading down the same path) but I fear it will take a few more. The solution is really simple - they need to adjust their hiring policy to include persons of talent.","1","15 February 2024"
"movieman6-413-929510","Madame Web is a new spin-off set in the Marvel Spider-Man world. This spin-off is directed, partly written and produced by S. J. Clarkson. Before this film, she directed more TV series episodes of superhero shows such as Jessica Jones and The Defenders.Cassandra Webb (Dakota Johnson) works as a paramedic in New York and learns after an accident that she has superpowers to see future possibilities. She sees that the lives of three girls are threatened by a mysterious masked man with spider-like powers.This is why she tries to protect the three girls and must convince them that their lives are really in danger. To truly protect them, they must ensure that the three listen to her and learn to work together.The story of this film has an interesting concept, but the final story and screenplay were written by five different writers. These writers do not always seem to have been on the same page, because the story sometimes seems a bit rushed or frayed. It sometimes seems as if they didn't really know what exactly to do with it, or what the film studio despised of them. The screenplay has also been rewritten many times, so the cast members could no longer always follow exactly where they were going or supposed to do with the film.Despite these messy, rushed aspects, the film remains on a familiar, predictable side for a superhero film. This can make the film seem a bit long-winded or embarrassing. The film is reminiscent of other superhero films that came out around the year 2000, but of a somewhat lesser quality.The visual effects don't always look believable either. The blue screen and CGI can be seen in the film. For some of the cast members, this was also the first time they had actually worked in a film with such visual effects. The fact that they have little or no experience with these film situations is sometimes reflected in their acting.The poor script also gives the cast members few opportunities to make something special of their roles. Dakota Johnson also seemed a bit uncomfortable during promotions of the film, or ignorant of how to properly promote this film. In the final film she tries to make the best of the role and tries to add some comedy to the role, but she doesn't always get the chance to do this. Sydney Sweeney, Isabela Merced and Celeste O'Connor play the three girls Cassandra tries to protect. All three are given a little time to give their characters some personalities, but unfortunately not enough to make you as a viewer really care about the three. For a better focused film, they might have been better off using a character in the story, who Cassandra then has to protect. Tahar Rahim plays the villain in the film, who tries to kill the three girls, but also deals with the poor, weak script. As a result, he does not emerge as strongly as the villain of the story. They also didn't incorporate his audio work well into the film, because his lips sometimes don't always match what his character is saying.With all these superhero spin-off films from the Sony film studio, they only make Marvel's current film series more messy. If Sony and Disney Marvel try to collaborate on the same film series, they will have to consult each other more and better and plan where they want to go with this film series.","2","17 February 2024"
"ethanbresnett","Based on Madame Web's woeful reviews I was expecting this film to be an utter car crash. To its credit I will say it isn't entirely without merit, but it is incredibly boring and bland.Mostly this is because nothing particularly happens. It's a superhero movie with little to no superhero action and a painfully long set up for an underwhelming final act. The characters are so underdeveloped that there is no emotional connection or investment in any of them. Everything about the story and writing just feels lazy, vacuous and corny.Then there's the villain who is utterly uninspiring. He is constantly complaining about 'everything he has built' being destroyed. What has he built you might ask? The film has no interest in exploring this question. He's easily one of the more two dimensional and weak superhero villains I've ever seen committed to screen.Perhaps the most heinous crime this movie commits is to waste the talents of Dakota Johnson, Sydney Sweeney, Adam Scott, Emma Roberts, Zosia Mamet and more. Such a good cast was assembled and they were given absolutely nothing to work with, so I don't blame the performers. It's just such a shame to see such great talent put to the sword like this.As if all of this wasn't enough, the movie also feels remarkably low budget and feels excruciatingly long despite its relatively short runtime.Ultimately I think this film suffered because it was clearly intended as a set up for a wider Spider-Woman franchise which is unlikely to come to fruition. There seemed to be no interest in making a good stand alone movie, and no respect for the audience. A massive waste of time.","3","21 February 2024"
"vfphvnpp","I understand what the plan was here. They wanted a trippy film, focusing on a strong future for the Sony verse. The problem is the delivery. The camera work in this movie made it quite irritating to follow, as there was constant quick close up shots of the action. The dialogue was awful, and there was quite a lot of blatant voice over during the villain scenes.So much wasted time was given to boring scenes in the movie, which led me to believe the screen writers finished the script and realised that it was under the word count.Honestly the acting quality was quite poor across the board, especially the villain, who honestly seems as if they didn't cast for his role at all, just picked up someone off the side of the road.For someone who's guilty pleasure is watching bad movies, I it was a painful time. Don't recommend.","2","14 February 2024"
"jtorch-11283","Don't waste your time, and money seeing this in theaters. I was fooled by the trailer which looked promising. All the action in the whole film ( a total of 2 scenes) is shown in the the trailer. The rest of the movie is just terrible acting trying to save an even worse scrip.I'm honestly not sure how this made it to the big screen. I'm not a cinema expert, but shouldn't someone have to view the finished product and give the O. K. At some point before it is ""audience ready?"" I feel like that step in the process was skipped. I don't know what Marvel had to do with this film, but it certainly isn't the Iron-Man-Marvel I keep hoping they will somehow revive.And to whom it may concern, ""my parents don't love me."" Is neither a solid backstory OR a strong character trait. I hope you eat a lot of money on this movie.","1","15 February 2024"
"cosby_don","I don't know where to start-actually, I do! THIS IS THE WORST MOVIE IN THE HISTORY OF HUMANITY. I'm not kidding.I'm not sure what other movie this Dakota Johnson has been in, but after watching THIS movie, I'll probably never support her again. This was an absolute career killer. Ms. Johnson, please FIRE your agent immediately.To the production crew, editors, director, and ESPECIALLY the writers (I counted 4 writers-that's RIDICULOUS), shame on you for contributing to this mess. It's obvious you've traded in your morals for a paycheck. That's Hollywood for ya'.Did I mention that this movie was HORRENDOUSLY bad? Everything about this movie was bad-there are ZERO redeeming qualities.The story: STUPID. Worst I've ever seen, seriously. Madam Web ask the girls to wait for 3 hours in the woods? STUPID. The guy partner keeping the girls as Madam Web flies to Peru to check something out. STUPID. Madam a Web getting her powers from a spider bite through her mother. STUPID. I could seriously go on and on. I'm not kidding-EVERYTHING in this movie was STUPID. I can't count how many times I shook my head and said ""This is so bad.""The acting? Very wooden. Ms. Dakota Johnson's acting chops were the worst of the worst here. I really pray that she's done work much better. The other girls-they tried. Jokes fell flat, and they said the DUMBEST lines ever in a movie. I was seriously angry at how dumb they were.The villain? The most generic, uninteresting, uncool villain over ever seen on film. Not one memorable quote. Come to think, did he even make a ""evil guy"" speech? Nope!The ending? Oh my, HORRENDOUS. She's smiling in her glasses while paralyzed in a wheel chair? MAN WHI WROTE THIS MESS??The girls weren't even in costume more than 2 minutes of the entire film, even though in the trailer we came to expect them to be crime fighters and kicking butt in the film.

"rgkarim","LIKES:The Commentary At Times
-Some lines in this movie are startling at how funny they were for me, a fantastic bout of teenage emotions with a less than thrilled babysitter.-Madame Web's origin story is almost like an anti-hero tale to Charles Xavier idea, and though it's not fully fleshed out, there is emotion, fun, and what felt natural angst and vulnerability into it.-With the right timing, and build up, this section of commentary was a striking positive in this reviewers book.Representation of Paramedics
-It's a rare thing to get to actually see E. M. T's in their work and what they give to serve the public.-While a bit forced, and perhaps a tad overdone and cheesy, kudos for Madame Web accomplishing some detailed shots of them serving the public and giving a little character development with it.-There were great avenues taken to help ingrain parts into the story, and with that, the medical nerd inside me found a cool little nod in those sequences.Some Artistic Visuals Are Cool
-I'm a sucker for a good shot and a good artistic visual popping out and ingraining itself into my mind.-Madame Web has some of these moments for me, the creepy and yet serene world of the Web World, being one that holds majesty and mystery, but also the very emotions of the person trying to wield it.-Other shots of costume crusaders striking that right pose, or perhaps that nostalgic early 2000s look, really help establish some of the themes of the movie or a good set up visual to cascade into.-It may be sprinkled about, but there were some superhero visuals that accomplished the job for me in Madame Web.Talented Cast
-Celeste O'Connor is very fun in this movie. A tad quirky, but she keeps the attitude going, a lot of that sass very fun and usually well-placed to help move the story towards forced comedy and obvious story telling.-Merced eventually grew on me after she got into the meat of her character and starting to push past the stubborn and cheeky attitude. She's got charming charisma, a fun brainy side to exploit, and this sadness that she uses to illicit such emotion, something I wanted more of, but got only little.-Sweeney is fun in this movie. Toned down from the other roles I've seen, the woman knows how to adapt her style and give me something to hook to several times. I love the awkwardness she brings, the tie in to the two extremes, and her surprising smallness after she plays such big roles.-And Johnson is about the same as she always is. A snarky and condescending nature that she wields expertly, but a tad dry at times that some lines feel unfulfilled. Fortunately, she's got good chemistry with the girls that assisted in smoothing out the faults.Some Surprising Character Arcs
-The movie may miss a lot of things, but there are a few moments that work very well to show the potential of Madame Web if given the right focus.-An opening that holds some merit was one of the victories, something that would eventually bleed into plot points further on that gave you a very touching moment.-And another element has the other's origin stories granting us some potential hurt and relatable tales to latch onto and acknowledge. Again, helping give a young and in your face Charlie's Angel group some vim and vigor.The Music
-Call me a sucker for nostalgia, Madame Web has a mix of songs that were perfect for viewers like me to enjoy.-Comedic use of the songs are not the most creative, but add that minor element to help give the girls a little more dynamic and believability.-While other times, it's just a blast of the speakers and me dancing in my seat as the forgotten wonder returns for another run to get things started.DISLIKES:The Pacing Uneven
-Despite the trinkets and some merits to the story, Madame Web's dislikes for me start with the pacing of the tale.-A moderately slow start did little to keep me engaged, only to then have these sprints of faster moments to try to change things up, before hitting the brakes again.-Like a CW season crammed into one, Madame Web's pacing feels a lot like dressed up teenage drama trying to give realism and gradual steps, but really just being the mashup of the uglier time use dramas can get stuck to.The Stale Mechanic
-From the trailers, you know there is some type of vision gimmick that Cassie is supposed to use to protect her charges.-That gimmick gets stale very quickly for a viewer like me, the convoluted presentation starting out fun at first, but then turning into annoying déjà vu that felt more like reshoots than actual artistic twisting.-Like Moon Knight, that element makes sense at first, but really could have stopped halfway through the movie once the viewers has connected the powers.-Had there been a bit more excitement, fighting, or even better storytelling to distract, it would have been less impactful, but alas, for me, all the other limitations added up.Lack of Other Character Development
-There are a lot of characters in this movie, some played by bigger names than the leads themselves. And yet, their time and character development felt shoehorned than planned out.-Adam Scott and Emma Roberts seem disengaged, with stories that are cliché, simplistic, and a waste of talent that again showed potential with that slower pacing at the start.-But even the villain and main girls tales feel very bland, and that lack of character development was very much felt by me that it almost seems to rely heavily on another movie to do these characters justice.Annoying Dialogue
-I know, I said the commentary was good, but that was a small amount of it compared to the whole.-Madame Web's dialogue seems to have gone through the writing grinder several times, very loaded with one liners, sassy comments and attitude that seemed to be out of place for much of the film for me.-Statements of the obvious, corny dialogue essentially pushed in with too simplistic of writing and in your face, overdramatic flair to count as quality dialogue. It needs tuning up, needs to be less forceful, and try to add a little Hollywood magic to help tenderize it to something matching a comic book movie.A Villain Needing A Lot More
-Don't get me wrong, there is an element to him that is relatable, believable, and indeed threatening in terms of the madness of his actions.-But outside of this and the opening scene, Ezekiel is a very bland bad guy who just didn't get the time to shine outside of crawling and repeating the same lines over and over.-The direction failed to give him any recognizable skills, his threats empty most of the time and sort of creepy obsessive, and dare I say his actual character is zoomed over and practically absent but for the opening line.-To me, that's a limited villain and one major flaw that much of the movie suffers from.Visuals Get Really Muddy/Bad
-Sony makes such great looking video games, and yet their movies still suffer from last gen effects
-While the artistic flair of those moments was enjoyable, they did have that faux effect that dropped some of the realism this movie was going for.-Even worse, there are lots of movements, character renderings, and powers that leave a lot to be desired in looking their best. I won't say it's a dealbreaker, but it doesn't help to have such limited technology presentation.Scenes/Story Seem Very Chopped Up
-Between the gimmicks and pacing, the scenes already feel limited, messy, and almost like an abbreviated version of what they could be.-Sure, the dialogue gives you everything they are going for, but the presentation felt very much like a lot of reshoots of the same scene, and slight changes that made little difference.-Such indecisive direction and edits got away from them and left me just wondering what this film could have been with half the gimmicks of the visions pulled back.The Action Is Very Boring
-No denying this, Madame Web maybe even worse than many of the CW attempts at action.-While witty, and an amusing game of cat and mouse, a Spiderverse without a solid one or two fights is a verse I'm not fond playing in for nearly two hours.-A lame villain does little but strut and crawl, while our cast somehow running away and eluding comes off a bit pathetic than entertaining.-Even the climax is a mess, rushed finishes, suspense of disbelief, and an overdramatic battle of words with a very extravagant and mushy ending to cap it off.-Eternals at least had a few moves that had me rocking in my seat, but this... this was a challenge to stay awake in.The VERDICT:
Madame Web is certainly not the worst movie I've seen in years, but that doesn't mean Sony's latest is a masterpiece either. There are elements of this vision that show the potential for a good future, but need a lot of work to make up for this rushed installment. A talented cast, music and some fun writing can be the starting building blocks, but it can't offset what feels like lots of production limitations, rewrites, and editing that greatly show in this movie. Boring battles, annoying gimmicks, and under developed characters despite a strong cast were just some of the limitations this movie has to work through if a series is to come with it. Should one see it in theaters? Not really. A shot at home, I would say sure, but with all of this, my scores for the movie are:Action/Adventure/Sci-Fi: 6.0
Movie Overall: 5.0.","5","15 February 2024"
"eddie_baggins","I'm not ashamed to admit I've seen some movies in my time.I am however ashamed to admit curiosity got the better of me and I ended up in an almost entirely empty cinema screening (thanks to one tolerant movie buddy who joined me on my trip to the local cinema) partaking in what can only be described as one of the most universally panned Hollywood blockbusters of the modern era.Not at all interested in watching another Sony Marvel outing after their last few efforts, hearing about the insanely awesome awfulness of Madame Web from friends, internet identities and esteemed critics made me want to witness a potential all-time cringe-fest and while when people are absolutely right in their hyperbole around just how bad Madame Web is, I'm still trying to comprehend how I could possibly testify to just how bad things are here.Directed by long time TV episode director S. J. Clarkson and featuring a cast of performers who have all proven over time to be more than capable of bringing the goods, Madame Web is not devoid of talent that may have been able to salvage some type of goodness from an offence against the entire cinematic medium but as a finished? (Honestly I am unsure how anyone could claim this is an acceptable final version, just watch for some of the most flawed examples of ADR you're ever going to see) product there was no one or any thing that could've saved this nightmare from the fate it had created for itself.An experience that could only possibly come from a collective group who all gave up the fight to save it long before shooting had wrapped, Madame Web inexcusably comes from the same penmanship that was guilty of unleashing Morbius on us but screenwriters Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless at least managed to find some cult like goodness in Jared Leto and Matt Smith's wildly OTT characters and bizarre action segments but Madame Web is nothing more than two hours of terrible plot, characters, spectacle and intentions and there is quite literally no valid reason for this movie to exist in the form it has been given.One of the most atrociously acted Hollywood films ever captured, with lead Dakota Johnson unable to hold back her disdain for a film she clearly hated being a part of and poor old Tahar Rahim taking the films most unfortunate mantle from a wigged Sydney Sweeney, Madame Web may have been promoted as some type of intense action thriller following the exploits of Johnson's Cassandra Webb as she battles Rahim's Ezekiel Sims alongside Sweeney's Julia, Isabela Merced's Anya and Celeste O'Connor's Mattie but we get something else entirely that is hard to come to terms with.From some of the most detestable and frequent examples of product placement that becomes instantly iconic (some viewers may find themselves attempting to crack open a Pepsi can in their Calvin Klein's after a viewing), a villain we literally know nothing about with zero attempts to bother explaining his plans or background, an embarrassing use of comic staple characters that aren't even put into action outside of dream sequences and a script that must surely have been conjured on ChatGPT, Madame Web is a cesspool of Hollywood excrement that isn't even funny in its horribleness, just merely sad and depressing.The only justifiable reason for Madame Web to be the film it is as it stands is if Sony are deliberately attempting to sabotage their Marvel property that no longer is allowed to include many fan favourites, if they aren't in fact doing that there is zero excuses for why Madame Web has ever been allowed to be birthed into existence.An irredeemable, amateurish and embarrassing exercise in pointless, Madame Web is a shockingly bad example of blockbuster filmmaking that is the exact type of bottom feeder product the cinema industry and the Marvel brand didn't need at this particular point of time.Final Say -If you're a glutton for punishment and want to be reminded of everything you wouldn't wish to see in a supposed piece of big screen entertainment then Madame Web is for you! A truly iconic new addition to the staples of all-time misfires, nothing could prepare one for the garbage that is this $80 million dollar disasterpiece.0 fireworks to the head out of 5.Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)","1","22 February 2024"
"shaikhirshad-41223","Literally I had zero expectations when I went to watch this flick but I still thought that something should be good in this to watch at least one time because of marvel name in it. But this movie is so low and looks like low budget CGI thriller and a comedy in the name of superhero genre.I mean from the start itself movie lost it's pace and story and god only knows what are they showing no interest in the screenplay and the plot is not even engaging to watch for at least 30 mins.I only went for Dakota & Sydney just because the screen presence of them looks good, but the director loss this opportunity too. Because the character they're playing is so bad and not even proper dialogues are given and just they have made a common character with no story arc just the situation that they have to act
I've never seen such a bad cinematography of any film it looks like they don't have any interest making this film so they just made a spoof just to show that we are making a movie. Don't know what to say more because this film is that bad.Overall a Boring fest and a spoof fo a superhero genre.","2","16 February 2024"
"vengeance20","Ok, so before people come at me with the ""YoU dIdN't LiKe It BeCaUsE iT wAs FeMaLe LeAd."" chestnut. I went into this one with an open mind, but expecting it to be as described & the reviews were right. The film is bad.The film sees Cassandra Webb who is a New York metropolis paramedic who begins to demonstrate signs of clairvoyance. Forced to challenge revelations about her past, she needs to safeguard 3 young girls from a deadly adversary who wants them destroyed.I found the film to be pretty bad. It's disjointed, clunky, poorly paced & just feels very awkward & stiff. The characters are personality-less, they look & sound as if they're reciting their lines from cue cards (almost robotic, I might add) & the script reads like a supermarket shopping receipt.The films story is all over the place, confusing & hard to follow. The premonition sequences the main lead experiences were annoying & while creative, were repetitive to the point where you couldn't tell if she was hallucinating or actually seeing what she was seeing.The films runtime is overly long for what it is, while not as bad as other films which are generally over 2 hours (rolls eyes), this film felt longer & as I said was too long for what it was at 1 hour & 48 minutes (108 minutes) without credits & the pacing, jeez... don't get me started.The actors were alright, but what they were given script wise, didn't work & made them come across as flat. There's some action & not bad effects to be had, but that's pretty much the only redeeming features from this flick, sadly. It hasn't a lot going for it & is pretty lack luster & basic.Don't get me wrong, I prefer films with straight forward story-lines & plots you can follow, but this one was a bit too basic & could've used more meatiness to beef it up more as well as more emphasis to keep the audience engaged with the story, characters, action etc.I generally didn't like the film & the ending is just out there too & is pretty cringy like some of the scenes in the film as well as the few cringy action sequences themselves among some of the good action we got.Overall, it's a bad film. And no, it's got nothing to do with the old chestnut of me being a man who doesn't like the film because it's female lead. The film was bad & had plenty of things wrong with it. People in general, men & women, boys & girls, didn't like this flick.The story is bland, boring & paper thin like the characters & leads, the little bit of good action & effects seen are overshadowed by the aforementioned issues as well as the other issues like the poor runtime, pacing & the lacking engagement the film has.Also, for those who can't seem to get it in their heads, there's been plenty of female lead films in the past that have done well, from the Alien Franchise to The Hunger Games along with Elektra, Tomb Raider, Salt, Lucy, Hanna etc. I could go on but that's my rant for those who need calling out.2/10.","2","20 February 2024"
"izadyardariush","I could tell from the beginning, making this movie was a bad idea. After I saw the cast I could tell this movie doomed. I have nothing against any of those actors but I must say casting a Dakota was a biggest mistake for the role! Anyone read the comics could say that. This movie was like terminator meeting final destination! No good story, big mess, lot of waste of potentials. I must say worst choice of villain!

"alindsayal","With Marvel Studios taking on more responsibility involving Spider-Man, Sony have decided to try and build a universe involving smaller characters from the same lore as him. We have had Venom and Morbius and will get Kraven The Hunter later this year but here we have Madame Web. I saw this film last night and here is my review for Madame Web. The p[remise of the film sees a women bestowed with powers where she has to save 3 girls from being killed by a villainous foe.Main Character
I must be honest that I have never been a huge fan of Dakota Johnson and she plays Cassandra Web here and I have to be honest she isn't particularly good here. She is overacting everything here and her character is super unlikeable and hard to care about. She is clearly hampered by the awful writing in this film and she can't rise above it and give us a lead role to support or care about and Cassie Web will go down as one of the worst leads in a comic book film ever.Supporting Characters
Sydney Sweeney, Isabela Merced & Celeste O'Connor play the three girls that are in the view of the villain and they are all pretty awful. Their characters are really awkward and not particularly likeable, the film tries to force you to like and care about these characters but it comes across poorly and these actresses aren't good enough to make me care.Tahar Rahim plays Ezekiel Sims and he is one of the more frustrating parts of this film because I have seen him be a good actor and this character had some potential but the film really flops here and makes him this over the top villain that is so stupid that it really takes you out of the film.Adam Scott as Ben Parker is probably the best person here but he isn't really given much to do and it still upsets me that he plays Ben Parker and it is really clear that this was just done to provide some stupid fan service that actually annoys me even more.Story
The story is nonsensical and completely stupid. The plot makes no sense and characters do things that make no sense, Cassie Web in particular is one of the dumbest characters that I have seen in recent movies. This film also tries its best to ruin the character of Spider-Man even though he isn't in the film and it is just the backdrop to this pretty dull and horrendous adventure.Script
This is a really awfully written film. Things make no sense, characters are unlikeable and there is no humour here at all. There are so many plot holes it is crazy and the film has nothing interesting about it at all.Style
I mean I guess the action scenes are okay and the bad guys suit was okay but that is it. The film is filmed really poorly, the editing looks unfinished and at times it is actually quite jarring to watch it. There are way too many jump scares especially for a film that is not a horror film. The trailer shows things that barely happen in the film and it feels like we were sold a different film that never got made.Overall
Overall, Madame Web is a truly disastrous film. This is up there with one of the worst films I have ever seen and is up there with the worst comic book films of all time. Though I am glad I saw this film to have this experience but at all cost avoid this garbage and do something better for 2 hours.Rating - 1/10.","1","16 February 2024"
"daisukereds","A baby-sitting movie in a Superhero setting, where the lead can see the future and has to prevent NOT-Spiderman from killing teenagers (because he has dreams/visions about them). The girls run and hide around a lot, some BS happens and then the movie ends.The foundation of the script is heavily written around a hollow core of ""parents and children"". The cinematography is actually good, and at least ""teaches"" how to do CPR. It also does away with showing premonitions every time something is to be changed near the end.. respecting the viewers intelligence in at least that aspect! And it's easy to follow (if you don't fall asleep) with how simplistic it is.Aside from that, it is barely anything else..
The movie itself isn't terrible.. it's just beyond bland and boring. Also, calling this a Superhero movie is really disingenuous and a marketing ploy to get people to see it. Stay home! There are no good action sequences and nobody is written memorably....
Venom making money was a mistake. Sony has half a franchise, and they can't get anyone talented enough to do something with it. And what they continue to release seems like high-budgeted fan fiction!","3","16 February 2024"
"isaacsundaralingam","Yea, this was garbage and that's saying plenty. It's actually adorable how little anyone cared about ""Madame Web"" - not just the audience, but the filmmakers and actors themselves. Written by the same people who wrote ""Morbius"", this movie is yet another reason to not let them anywhere near a writing software ever again.Not only was the movie unwatchable due to how lifeless it was, but it was also criminally boring. You're waiting for something to happen and you keep waiting right until the credits start to roll. Nothing about the movie was compelling, the plot was riddled with plot holes, the screenplay was lazy, the dialogues were dead and the acting was almost as if the actors were held captive and being forced to act as if everything was okay. It reeks of corporate greed and there isn't a single positive thing to say about this movie.We're only a month and half into the year and we already have a very strong contender for what might be the worst movie of the year, and it's not even close. Don't watch it, but if you do indeed decide to, I hope you lived a life well enough to have a crowded funeral.","1","19 February 2024"
"syntory","Look at the profiles for the writers that wrote Madame Web. You'll see virtually every movie they've written has a bad rating and bad reviews. Why then does Hollywood continually hire these same writers for these big budget films? I could understand if they wrote movies for Asylum Films because all their movies are terrible.Madame Web is god awful! Very difficult to sit through. None of the main characters are likeable. Even the villain is lame. It seems like the entire movie was written to set up a sequel. But why would people spend money to see the sequel of a movie that is one of the worst movies ever written? I'm shocked at how bad this movie is and if there is a sequel I certainly wont bother watching it.Stop hiring bad writers, Hollywood!","2","15 February 2024"
"MovieWarfare","I would absolutely love to be in these Sony meetings because I am absolutely baffled how things like Madame Web are getting greenlit.Madame Web is one of the worst superhero movies ever made! It has terrible writing, characters, action setpieces and even acting. Dakota Johnson is so dull and boring as the main lead but this is probably down to the terrible script.To be fair, the movie does have an interesting concept with this Final Destination x Terminator thing. However, it is so poorly executed that it makes Morbius look like The Dark Knight.Anyway give me the ""He Was in the Amazon With My Mom When She Was Researching Spiders Right Before She Died"" cut!","1","17 February 2024"
"chenp-54708","Literally one of the worst superhero movies I have ever seen.From the advertisements, I knew this movie wasn't going to be great but still, it surprised me how bad and boring it was. Everything about the direction, writing, characters, technical aspects, and designs are really awful. The writing is poor as there are many concepts, ideas and aspects that are messy and bland. The messy script creates poor dialogue from the cast and the characters are not interesting. The special effects looked even worse than the marketing and all of the performances were pretty bad. I honestly do feel bad for Dakota Johnson cause she is a good actress but she deserves to have better roles then this. It can be said for the same for the rest of the cast members.The uses of product placements are annoying, action moments are dull, and and all in all, it was boring. Superhero movies shouldn't be boring but this really dragged on. It's unfortunate cause female superhero leads are something I love to see more like Wonder Woman and The Old Guard which are pretty fun. But unfortunately, it seemed that it likely isn't going to happen anytime soon.There really isn't anything else to say.Bad.","1","14 February 2024"
"AlsExGal","... when I saw Dakota Johnson was starring in it. Naturally I can't lay the entirety of this hot mess at her feet. But there is some really bad campy acting happening on her part, reminiscent of the Fifty Shades of Grey movies in which she starred. Perhaps it was because the director was more interested in the placement of Pepsi cans than her performance, but I digress.Basically, this movie plays out like the cut scenes from a budget Xbox 360 game. From the ground up this thing just feels designed to fail. It feels almost Producersesque in its approach in just how every aspect is seemingly intentionally mangled, yet no one seems to care. How have we come so full circle to go through the glory of Infinity War/Logan/The Dark Knight to arrive all the way back to Batman and Robin and Catwoman levels of superhero flicks? (Bam!, Pow!, Gosh yes Batman!)How did this movie make it so far that it has an actual release, and no one stopped it? How did this idea get green lit? Why did Sony give 80 million and turn over their valuable IP to the people that wrote Morbius, Gods of Egypt, Dracula Untold and The Last Witch Hunter? How did this get past the writing process and again have that script greenlit? How could no one on the set at any point stop things? How did no one in the editing room point out how bad it looked and how much of a mess it was?But to the suits it's not about art and story. Instead it's about business, and people are just a commodity. It's cheaper to recycle known quantities, and practice nepotism and involve maybe less than talented friends, people you've worked with before, than go out and find artists with worthy stories. They don't care about art, they don't care about stories, they care about making this work for them financially, regardless of loss of reputation with audiences as a whole.Youtuber Chris Stuckmann did a deep dive on the topic of big studios being generally run by folks who came up through management rather than the creative rungs such as writing and directing when he discussed this film. His take is worth watching. For some reason, Chris doesn't do critical movie reviews since he has become a filmmaker, but I can tell by his tone that, like me, he was completely displeased watching this one. I'd avoid it.","2","17 February 2024"
"eoinageary","This is, well I guess this is a movie in the Sony universe that I'm SHOCKED is profitable.The story is all over the place, it's basically about Madame Web who is a paramedic and develops powers and can see into the future, with a current threat she tries to change the future, teaming up with 3 powerful characters who are yet to develop into their full potential so she must shield them and change the future to protect them.Trying not to give the little story that gets told away in the opening there but i have to be vague.What I liked, one or two good scenes, I didn't mind the end, I really liked a lot of the camera work some cool looking shots and a decent Score.But the movie is BAD, it makes Morbius look like The Batman 2022. The acting is lacking, the actors look as bored as you will feel. Script is bad, just some beyond silly lines, the story chops and changes so much your neck will hurt you, some bad CGI, and just boring action.And before people harp on about ""you don't like it because it's women leads"" no, it's just a crap film, I enjoyed the marvels, Black Widow was decent, so no, the movie regardless of its leads is just poor.Extremely disappointing, 3/10.","3","14 February 2024"

"hotrobinproductions","Horrible from beginning to end, the opening scene just reeks of awful predictability from story & plot to the core. You know exactly what will happen before it even happens, the script sucks & the dialogue is even worse. There is quite noticeable audio dub edited after the fact too. This budget is 80 million, not that budget matters, because no amount of money could have saved this train wreck, but I mention this because you can still make a good film on lower budgets, Shazam, the first one, had the same budget & delt with a lot of side characters too, it's miles better, Godzilla minus one had a extremely low budget too. But this 80 million dollar film not just effects but production, feels obviously cheap, it almost feels like watching a very long pilot episode to a CW tv show.You thought Morbius was bad, that film was bad because it did the bare minimum, this film doesn't even do the bare minimum, it goes beyond comprehension below that, it just enters a point of no originality or ambition towards creating anything. There isn't even a single superhero moment, even horrible films like catwoman or Morbius has superhero moments & action, this thing doesn't, you get instead visions of the future to potentially set up sequels.This movie also has a serious problem of product placement, it's a long commercial, to be exact a long Pepsi commercial, I feel like Pepsi stopped the halftime show so they could invest in the product placement in this film. This movie was more important to them than the superbowl LOL it's just so over the top & obviously placed way too much in this film. Calvin Klein, Chase bank, the list goes on. This movie should be called superhero product placement the movie.It's barely even close to a 1/10 the cool moments are seeing what we already saw in the trailer when she's seeing the future & you think it's happening now but then it goes back to the moment she realizes it's a vision, granted it's cool the first couple times but it gets old REAL quick. & it ends up getting annoying because it's abused way too much.Thats about it, there isn't any redeeming things in this film, the acting isn't even good. I would say the 3 side character spider women that Dakota finds when they are together there was a potential spark. I saw the talent & potential, but they are failed big time by such a horrid script that the spark never even sparks, it's just like showing you the matches & gasoline & not setting the fire.Madame M0RBIUS / 10.","1","16 February 2024"
"olcare","It's the worst movie and superhero adaptation I've watched in recent years. Completely atrocious effects, atrocious screenplay, and atrocious acting. Also, a big insult to all comic book readers and those who know the original story.Let me describe the movie simply. First of all, I am filled with hatred; I really want to curse the entire creative team for this unacceptable film.All the performances are bad, everyone. There's not a single good actor trying; everyone just took the role for money. It's a terrible disgrace, a total eclipse of reason.The screenplay is the worst superhero screenplay I've ever seen. It barely resembles the original story, and if there aren't scenes like the other Spider-Girls in the trailer, why include them? There's no such obligation; instead, write a decent screenplay. All action scenes are full of logical errors; they've written it without thinking, it's complete garbage.Apart from these, the direction, sorry to say, is garbage too. Most scenes are shot as if they were taken straight from a phone camera; action scenes are not shown, they're hidden due to the atrociousness of the effects. It's shameful.After these general points, Sony urgently needs to cancel this universe; the original stories are garbage, there's no logic, no connection anywhere. They're just being shot randomly. I don't like to curse, but I hope this film sinks at the box office.The last scene with Madame Web gaining her powers, those web effects, clinging to souls, it's unbelievable how you approved this film, may God punish you.I don't know which one to talk about; all the atrocities are collected in this film. Whether it's the woman going to Peru and back in 30 seconds, Spider-Man dodging with fireworks, dancing at the boys' table when my daughters are left alone, not telling the story of the Spider-Human community, or the woman talking normally while giving birth at the end, everything is a disgrace. I hope this universe sinks, and you all get fired. No one involved in the management of this film deserves their job respectfully; they should quit immediately.Note: Dakota Johnson made a statement saying she didn't watch the movie. Why are you serving a completely garbage film if you're not going to watch it? Life shouldn't be all about money for you; we, in our poverty, are trying to watch it, and this is no different from cursing all the audience's families. Shame on you.Note 2: Just now, I looked at the budget of the movie, and my anger grew even more, 80 million dollars EIGHTY MILLION. How can I not believe this money, I really can't believe it, it's nothing but disrespect to yourself, disrespect to the audience, nothing but an insult.","1","16 February 2024"
"sinscopefilms","First Impression:The opening of the Madame Web was immersed in a mystique and ambition, enhanced by great musical score; yet, as the movie progresses, it becomes a mixed bag and a rollercoaster of emotions.The Positive:Musical Score and Sound Design: The standout feature of ""Madame Web"" is its musical score. The soundtrack not only enhances the emotional depth of the film but also succeeds in creating in some moments genuine goosebumps. The sound design really enhances this impact by carefully using sound pans, bass, and reverse effects. It creates a sense of tension and immersion which is one of the film's strongest features.The Mixed:Visual Effects and Costume Design: Some of the visual effects in ""Madame Web"" were visually appealing. The costume design, like Casey's red jacket and the three spider girl villain outfits standing out as particularly stunning contributions to the film's aesthetic, but it was not often shown in the film since the films direction and focus was different. I was disappointed.Acting and Direction: Although I thought Casey's character development - her ability to see the world from a different perspective - was great, I didn't like how it was visually presented. The way it was edited was poorly done. The editor could use 2 distinct color grading features where one sees the future and two, she sees the present moment.However, The performances throughout the film feel lackluster, with the actors appearing confused and disengaged. This, combined with direction that fails to maintain interest or coherence in many scenes, significantly undermines the film's potential.Negatives:Cinematography: Cinematography is bad since some pictures don't show a clear image. The camera moves so fast that I cannot comprehend the picture. I kind of recognized that it tries to initiate the rapidness of the events from the spider's eye point of view but it was a tasteless decision. The Cinematography is not something like wow. The reason why Cinematography was lacking is because it was heavily based on medium closeups and dutch tilts which on one hand was a unique choice but on the other hand very hard to watch. I found the 180 degree round camera rotations super cool, but again, I expected varied distance shots, not just medium shots. The train scene Cinematography was the best in the film.Editing and Pace: The editing is arguably the weakest element of ""Madame Web,"" with its rapid cuts and disjointed flow detracting significantly from the storytelling. This lack of coherence makes it challenging for the audience to fully engage with the narrative.Plot and Overall Execution: The storyline of ""Madame Web"" is cluttered and clichéd, suffering from a lack of originality and clear direction. The film's ambition is evident, but the execution falls short of creating a compelling narrative.The Conclusion:""Madame Web"" presents a paradoxical experience, with exceptional music and sound design standing that sharply contrasts with its various flaws in editing, cinematography, and direction.Although there are some visually and emotionally stunning moments, they are frequently overshadowed by a lack of coherence and clarity.Also, I think this film would be reasonable and great to be incorporated in a TV series which would have allowed for a more in-depth exploration of characters and plot.Nevertheless, Madame Web is a bit of a mixed bag, with moments of potential that ultimately leave the viewer something different visually.Rating: 3/10.","3","15 February 2024"
"Skruffbagg","Cannon, is that you in disguise?I firmly believe Madame Web will go down in history as not only the worst superhero movie, but also one of the worst movies ever made. It's that bad. It's absolutely fascinating to behold.Now, I'll be honest with you here. I only went to see this because I had heard it was an unmitigated disaster that had to be seen to be believed, and it truly does not disappoint - or massively does, depending on your viewpoint.It takes a special kind of director to get such cringe-inducing performances out of a fairly talented cast (Dakota Johnson and Tahar Rahim are both quality actors with the right script and direction), but SJ Clarkson somehow manages to wrangle the absolute worst imaginable from every single person in the film. I'll be very surprised if she ever does another feature after this.Nothing in this film works; the plot is moronic, the script seems like it was written by a teenager, the cinematography is horrendous, the aformentioned embarrassing performances, the audio editing is baffling (so much dubbing, brain-melting music choices). I'm amazed this didn't get shelved the minute the final cut was done.To me, I rate this as ""so bad it's good"" as I wasn't bored watching it, but most people I assume will say it's just plain bad... and it is, but very entertainingly so.If you love watching a 2hr car crash then I highly recommend this. The awfulness is mind-boggling in it's complexity, but in the best possible way. Film scholars and historians will be analysing this movie for years to come, and I hope it is talked about in the same vein as The Room in the future.An absolutely epic misfire on all levels.","1","20 February 2024"
"MiroslavKyuranov","It's astonishing to think that Sony could put out a worse product than 2022's Morbius, but boy, ""Madame Web"" manages it. It is an embarrassing mess. Talented stars wasted on probably one of the worst comic book movie ever (which nobody asked for). Filled with atrocious dialogue, awkward editing and laughable structure. It's a clunky, poorly-written, messy, and sloppy movie packed with some mediocre editing and performances.The concept is interesting on paper, but it couldn't be saved due to it's terrible execution. ""Madame Web"" simply lacked the spark it needed in nearly every dept.There is simply nothing memorable in this movie, except maybe some superhero costumes, but that doesn't redeem the fact that the movie is bad.So yeah...""Madame Web"" is yet another disappointing entry in the Sony's Spider-Less universe. It's like a love letter to an era of superhero films that people largely want to forget. The ""Pepsi"" adds are stand-out, it falls short of what could have been a decent movie in the hands of someone else twenty years ago.","4","14 February 2024"

It's badly written - not just full of clichés but full of dialogue that is meant to sound like cliché superhero idioms yet butchered until they make no sense. It is nothing but a costume parade with players that are dead behind the eyes. You can tell that everybody involved knows it's going to be a stinker but they'd already signed on and it was too late. It would be great if this was the flop that made Disney rethink their output (I know, this is actually an SSU movie not an MCU movie, but they are all heading down the same path) but I fear it will take a few more. The solution is really simple - they need to adjust their hiring policy to include persons of talent.","1","15 February 2024"
"movieman6-413-929510","Madame Web is a new spin-off set in the Marvel Spider-Man world. This spin-off is directed, partly written and produced by S. J. Clarkson. Before this film, she directed more TV series episodes of superhero shows such as Jessica Jones and The Defenders.Cassandra Webb (Dakota Johnson) works as a paramedic in New York and learns after an accident that she has superpowers to see future possibilities. She sees that the lives of three girls are threatened by a mysterious masked man with spider-like powers.This is why she tries to protect the three girls and must convince them that their lives are really in danger. To truly protect them, they must ensure that the three listen to her and learn to work together.The story of this film has an interesting concept, but the final story and screenplay were written by five different writers. These writers do not always seem to have been on the same page, because the story sometimes seems a bit rushed or frayed. It sometimes seems as if they didn't really know what exactly to do with it, or what the film studio despised of them. The screenplay has also been rewritten many times, so the cast members could no longer always follow exactly where they were going or supposed to do with the film.Despite these messy, rushed aspects, the film remains on a familiar, predictable side for a superhero film. This can make the film seem a bit long-winded or embarrassing. The film is reminiscent of other superhero films that came out around the year 2000, but of a somewhat lesser quality.The visual effects don't always look believable either. The blue screen and CGI can be seen in the film. For some of the cast members, this was also the first time they had actually worked in a film with such visual effects. The fact that they have little or no experience with these film situations is sometimes reflected in their acting.The poor script also gives the cast members few opportunities to make something special of their roles. Dakota Johnson also seemed a bit uncomfortable during promotions of the film, or ignorant of how to properly promote this film. In the final film she tries to make the best of the role and tries to add some comedy to the role, but she doesn't always get the chance to do this. Sydney Sweeney, Isabela Merced and Celeste O'Connor play the three girls Cassandra tries to protect. All three are given a little time to give their characters some personalities, but unfortunately not enough to make you as a viewer really care about the three. For a better focused film, they might have been better off using a character in the story, who Cassandra then has to protect. Tahar Rahim plays the villain in the film, who tries to kill the three girls, but also deals with the poor, weak script. As a result, he does not emerge as strongly as the villain of the story. They also didn't incorporate his audio work well into the film, because his lips sometimes don't always match what his character is saying.With all these superhero spin-off films from the Sony film studio, they only make Marvel's current film series more messy. If Sony and Disney Marvel try to collaborate on the same film series, they will have to consult each other more and better and plan where they want to go with this film series.","2","17 February 2024"
"ethanbresnett","Based on Madame Web's woeful reviews I was expecting this film to be an utter car crash. To its credit I will say it isn't entirely without merit, but it is incredibly boring and bland.Mostly this is because nothing particularly happens. It's a superhero movie with little to no superhero action and a painfully long set up for an underwhelming final act. The characters are so underdeveloped that there is no emotional connection or investment in any of them. Everything about the story and writing just feels lazy, vacuous and corny.Then there's the villain who is utterly uninspiring. He is constantly complaining about 'everything he has built' being destroyed. What has he built you might ask? The film has no interest in exploring this question. He's easily one of the more two dimensional and weak superhero villains I've ever seen committed to screen.Perhaps the most heinous crime this movie commits is to waste the talents of Dakota Johnson, Sydney Sweeney, Adam Scott, Emma Roberts, Zosia Mamet and more. Such a good cast was assembled and they were given absolutely nothing to work with, so I don't blame the performers. It's just such a shame to see such great talent put to the sword like this.As if all of this wasn't enough, the movie also feels remarkably low budget and feels excruciatingly long despite its relatively short runtime.Ultimately I think this film suffered because it was clearly intended as a set up for a wider Spider-Woman franchise which is unlikely to come to fruition. There seemed to be no interest in making a good stand alone movie, and no respect for the audience. A massive waste of time.","3","21 February 2024"
"vfphvnpp","I understand what the plan was here. They wanted a trippy film, focusing on a strong future for the Sony verse. The problem is the delivery. The camera work in this movie made it quite irritating to follow, as there was constant quick close up shots of the action. The dialogue was awful, and there was quite a lot of blatant voice over during the villain scenes.So much wasted time was given to boring scenes in the movie, which led me to believe the screen writers finished the script and realised that it was under the word count.Honestly the acting quality was quite poor across the board, especially the villain, who honestly seems as if they didn't cast for his role at all, just picked up someone off the side of the road.For someone who's guilty pleasure is watching bad movies, I it was a painful time. Don't recommend.","2","14 February 2024"
"jtorch-11283","Don't waste your time, and money seeing this in theaters. I was fooled by the trailer which looked promising. All the action in the whole film ( a total of 2 scenes) is shown in the the trailer. The rest of the movie is just terrible acting trying to save an even worse scrip.I'm honestly not sure how this made it to the big screen. I'm not a cinema expert, but shouldn't someone have to view the finished product and give the O. K. At some point before it is ""audience ready?"" I feel like that step in the process was skipped. I don't know what Marvel had to do with this film, but it certainly isn't the Iron-Man-Marvel I keep hoping they will somehow revive.And to whom it may concern, ""my parents don't love me."" Is neither a solid backstory OR a strong character trait. I hope you eat a lot of money on this movie.","1","15 February 2024"
"cosby_don","I don't know where to start-actually, I do! THIS IS THE WORST MOVIE IN THE HISTORY OF HUMANITY. I'm not kidding.I'm not sure what other movie this Dakota Johnson has been in, but after watching THIS movie, I'll probably never support her again. This was an absolute career killer. Ms. Johnson, please FIRE your agent immediately.To the production crew, editors, director, and ESPECIALLY the writers (I counted 4 writers-that's RIDICULOUS), shame on you for contributing to this mess. It's obvious you've traded in your morals for a paycheck. That's Hollywood for ya'.Did I mention that this movie was HORRENDOUSLY bad? Everything about this movie was bad-there are ZERO redeeming qualities.The story: STUPID. Worst I've ever seen, seriously. Madam Web ask the girls to wait for 3 hours in the woods? STUPID. The guy partner keeping the girls as Madam Web flies to Peru to check something out. STUPID. Madam a Web getting her powers from a spider bite through her mother. STUPID. I could seriously go on and on. I'm not kidding-EVERYTHING in this movie was STUPID. I can't count how many times I shook my head and said ""This is so bad.""The acting? Very wooden. Ms. Dakota Johnson's acting chops were the worst of the worst here. I really pray that she's done work much better. The other girls-they tried. Jokes fell flat, and they said the DUMBEST lines ever in a movie. I was seriously angry at how dumb they were.The villain? The most generic, uninteresting, uncool villain over ever seen on film. Not one memorable quote. Come to think, did he even make a ""evil guy"" speech? Nope!The ending? Oh my, HORRENDOUS. She's smiling in her glasses while paralyzed in a wheel chair? MAN WHI WROTE THIS MESS??The girls weren't even in costume more than 2 minutes of the entire film, even though in the trailer we came to expect them to be crime fighters and kicking butt in the film.

"rgkarim","LIKES:The Commentary At Times
-Some lines in this movie are startling at how funny they were for me, a fantastic bout of teenage emotions with a less than thrilled babysitter.-Madame Web's origin story is almost like an anti-hero tale to Charles Xavier idea, and though it's not fully fleshed out, there is emotion, fun, and what felt natural angst and vulnerability into it.-With the right timing, and build up, this section of commentary was a striking positive in this reviewers book.Representation of Paramedics
-It's a rare thing to get to actually see E. M. T's in their work and what they give to serve the public.-While a bit forced, and perhaps a tad overdone and cheesy, kudos for Madame Web accomplishing some detailed shots of them serving the public and giving a little character development with it.-There were great avenues taken to help ingrain parts into the story, and with that, the medical nerd inside me found a cool little nod in those sequences.Some Artistic Visuals Are Cool
-I'm a sucker for a good shot and a good artistic visual popping out and ingraining itself into my mind.-Madame Web has some of these moments for me, the creepy and yet serene world of the Web World, being one that holds majesty and mystery, but also the very emotions of the person trying to wield it.-Other shots of costume crusaders striking that right pose, or perhaps that nostalgic early 2000s look, really help establish some of the themes of the movie or a good set up visual to cascade into.-It may be sprinkled about, but there were some superhero visuals that accomplished the job for me in Madame Web.Talented Cast
-Celeste O'Connor is very fun in this movie. A tad quirky, but she keeps the attitude going, a lot of that sass very fun and usually well-placed to help move the story towards forced comedy and obvious story telling.-Merced eventually grew on me after she got into the meat of her character and starting to push past the stubborn and cheeky attitude. She's got charming charisma, a fun brainy side to exploit, and this sadness that she uses to illicit such emotion, something I wanted more of, but got only little.-Sweeney is fun in this movie. Toned down from the other roles I've seen, the woman knows how to adapt her style and give me something to hook to several times. I love the awkwardness she brings, the tie in to the two extremes, and her surprising smallness after she plays such big roles.-And Johnson is about the same as she always is. A snarky and condescending nature that she wields expertly, but a tad dry at times that some lines feel unfulfilled. Fortunately, she's got good chemistry with the girls that assisted in smoothing out the faults.Some Surprising Character Arcs
-The movie may miss a lot of things, but there are a few moments that work very well to show the potential of Madame Web if given the right focus.-An opening that holds some merit was one of the victories, something that would eventually bleed into plot points further on that gave you a very touching moment.-And another element has the other's origin stories granting us some potential hurt and relatable tales to latch onto and acknowledge. Again, helping give a young and in your face Charlie's Angel group some vim and vigor.The Music
-Call me a sucker for nostalgia, Madame Web has a mix of songs that were perfect for viewers like me to enjoy.-Comedic use of the songs are not the most creative, but add that minor element to help give the girls a little more dynamic and believability.-While other times, it's just a blast of the speakers and me dancing in my seat as the forgotten wonder returns for another run to get things started.DISLIKES:The Pacing Uneven
-Despite the trinkets and some merits to the story, Madame Web's dislikes for me start with the pacing of the tale.-A moderately slow start did little to keep me engaged, only to then have these sprints of faster moments to try to change things up, before hitting the brakes again.-Like a CW season crammed into one, Madame Web's pacing feels a lot like dressed up teenage drama trying to give realism and gradual steps, but really just being the mashup of the uglier time use dramas can get stuck to.The Stale Mechanic
-From the trailers, you know there is some type of vision gimmick that Cassie is supposed to use to protect her charges.-That gimmick gets stale very quickly for a viewer like me, the convoluted presentation starting out fun at first, but then turning into annoying déjà vu that felt more like reshoots than actual artistic twisting.-Like Moon Knight, that element makes sense at first, but really could have stopped halfway through the movie once the viewers has connected the powers.-Had there been a bit more excitement, fighting, or even better storytelling to distract, it would have been less impactful, but alas, for me, all the other limitations added up.Lack of Other Character Development
-There are a lot of characters in this movie, some played by bigger names than the leads themselves. And yet, their time and character development felt shoehorned than planned out.-Adam Scott and Emma Roberts seem disengaged, with stories that are cliché, simplistic, and a waste of talent that again showed potential with that slower pacing at the start.-But even the villain and main girls tales feel very bland, and that lack of character development was very much felt by me that it almost seems to rely heavily on another movie to do these characters justice.Annoying Dialogue
-I know, I said the commentary was good, but that was a small amount of it compared to the whole.-Madame Web's dialogue seems to have gone through the writing grinder several times, very loaded with one liners, sassy comments and attitude that seemed to be out of place for much of the film for me.-Statements of the obvious, corny dialogue essentially pushed in with too simplistic of writing and in your face, overdramatic flair to count as quality dialogue. It needs tuning up, needs to be less forceful, and try to add a little Hollywood magic to help tenderize it to something matching a comic book movie.A Villain Needing A Lot More
-Don't get me wrong, there is an element to him that is relatable, believable, and indeed threatening in terms of the madness of his actions.-But outside of this and the opening scene, Ezekiel is a very bland bad guy who just didn't get the time to shine outside of crawling and repeating the same lines over and over.-The direction failed to give him any recognizable skills, his threats empty most of the time and sort of creepy obsessive, and dare I say his actual character is zoomed over and practically absent but for the opening line.-To me, that's a limited villain and one major flaw that much of the movie suffers from.Visuals Get Really Muddy/Bad
-Sony makes such great looking video games, and yet their movies still suffer from last gen effects
-While the artistic flair of those moments was enjoyable, they did have that faux effect that dropped some of the realism this movie was going for.-Even worse, there are lots of movements, character renderings, and powers that leave a lot to be desired in looking their best. I won't say it's a dealbreaker, but it doesn't help to have such limited technology presentation.Scenes/Story Seem Very Chopped Up
-Between the gimmicks and pacing, the scenes already feel limited, messy, and almost like an abbreviated version of what they could be.-Sure, the dialogue gives you everything they are going for, but the presentation felt very much like a lot of reshoots of the same scene, and slight changes that made little difference.-Such indecisive direction and edits got away from them and left me just wondering what this film could have been with half the gimmicks of the visions pulled back.The Action Is Very Boring
-No denying this, Madame Web maybe even worse than many of the CW attempts at action.-While witty, and an amusing game of cat and mouse, a Spiderverse without a solid one or two fights is a verse I'm not fond playing in for nearly two hours.-A lame villain does little but strut and crawl, while our cast somehow running away and eluding comes off a bit pathetic than entertaining.-Even the climax is a mess, rushed finishes, suspense of disbelief, and an overdramatic battle of words with a very extravagant and mushy ending to cap it off.-Eternals at least had a few moves that had me rocking in my seat, but this... this was a challenge to stay awake in.The VERDICT:
Madame Web is certainly not the worst movie I've seen in years, but that doesn't mean Sony's latest is a masterpiece either. There are elements of this vision that show the potential for a good future, but need a lot of work to make up for this rushed installment. A talented cast, music and some fun writing can be the starting building blocks, but it can't offset what feels like lots of production limitations, rewrites, and editing that greatly show in this movie. Boring battles, annoying gimmicks, and under developed characters despite a strong cast were just some of the limitations this movie has to work through if a series is to come with it. Should one see it in theaters? Not really. A shot at home, I would say sure, but with all of this, my scores for the movie are:Action/Adventure/Sci-Fi: 6.0
Movie Overall: 5.0.","5","15 February 2024"
"eddie_baggins","I'm not ashamed to admit I've seen some movies in my time.I am however ashamed to admit curiosity got the better of me and I ended up in an almost entirely empty cinema screening (thanks to one tolerant movie buddy who joined me on my trip to the local cinema) partaking in what can only be described as one of the most universally panned Hollywood blockbusters of the modern era.Not at all interested in watching another Sony Marvel outing after their last few efforts, hearing about the insanely awesome awfulness of Madame Web from friends, internet identities and esteemed critics made me want to witness a potential all-time cringe-fest and while when people are absolutely right in their hyperbole around just how bad Madame Web is, I'm still trying to comprehend how I could possibly testify to just how bad things are here.Directed by long time TV episode director S. J. Clarkson and featuring a cast of performers who have all proven over time to be more than capable of bringing the goods, Madame Web is not devoid of talent that may have been able to salvage some type of goodness from an offence against the entire cinematic medium but as a finished? (Honestly I am unsure how anyone could claim this is an acceptable final version, just watch for some of the most flawed examples of ADR you're ever going to see) product there was no one or any thing that could've saved this nightmare from the fate it had created for itself.An experience that could only possibly come from a collective group who all gave up the fight to save it long before shooting had wrapped, Madame Web inexcusably comes from the same penmanship that was guilty of unleashing Morbius on us but screenwriters Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless at least managed to find some cult like goodness in Jared Leto and Matt Smith's wildly OTT characters and bizarre action segments but Madame Web is nothing more than two hours of terrible plot, characters, spectacle and intentions and there is quite literally no valid reason for this movie to exist in the form it has been given.One of the most atrociously acted Hollywood films ever captured, with lead Dakota Johnson unable to hold back her disdain for a film she clearly hated being a part of and poor old Tahar Rahim taking the films most unfortunate mantle from a wigged Sydney Sweeney, Madame Web may have been promoted as some type of intense action thriller following the exploits of Johnson's Cassandra Webb as she battles Rahim's Ezekiel Sims alongside Sweeney's Julia, Isabela Merced's Anya and Celeste O'Connor's Mattie but we get something else entirely that is hard to come to terms with.From some of the most detestable and frequent examples of product placement that becomes instantly iconic (some viewers may find themselves attempting to crack open a Pepsi can in their Calvin Klein's after a viewing), a villain we literally know nothing about with zero attempts to bother explaining his plans or background, an embarrassing use of comic staple characters that aren't even put into action outside of dream sequences and a script that must surely have been conjured on ChatGPT, Madame Web is a cesspool of Hollywood excrement that isn't even funny in its horribleness, just merely sad and depressing.The only justifiable reason for Madame Web to be the film it is as it stands is if Sony are deliberately attempting to sabotage their Marvel property that no longer is allowed to include many fan favourites, if they aren't in fact doing that there is zero excuses for why Madame Web has ever been allowed to be birthed into existence.An irredeemable, amateurish and embarrassing exercise in pointless, Madame Web is a shockingly bad example of blockbuster filmmaking that is the exact type of bottom feeder product the cinema industry and the Marvel brand didn't need at this particular point of time.Final Say -If you're a glutton for punishment and want to be reminded of everything you wouldn't wish to see in a supposed piece of big screen entertainment then Madame Web is for you! A truly iconic new addition to the staples of all-time misfires, nothing could prepare one for the garbage that is this $80 million dollar disasterpiece.0 fireworks to the head out of 5.Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)","1","22 February 2024"
"shaikhirshad-41223","Literally I had zero expectations when I went to watch this flick but I still thought that something should be good in this to watch at least one time because of marvel name in it.

Because the character they're playing is so bad and not even proper dialogues are given and just they have made a common character with no story arc just the situation that they have to act
I've never seen such a bad cinematography of any film it looks like they don't have any interest making this film so they just made a spoof just to show that we are making a movie.

"vengeance20","Ok, so before people come at me with the ""YoU dIdN't LiKe It BeCaUsE iT wAs FeMaLe LeAd."" chestnut. I went into this one with an open mind, but expecting it to be as described & the reviews were right. The film is bad.The film sees Cassandra Webb who is a New York metropolis paramedic who begins to demonstrate signs of clairvoyance. Forced to challenge revelations about her past, she needs to safeguard 3 young girls from a deadly adversary who wants them destroyed.I found the film to be pretty bad. It's disjointed, clunky, poorly paced & just feels very awkward & stiff. The characters are personality-less, they look & sound as if they're reciting their lines from cue cards (almost robotic, I might add) & the script reads like a supermarket shopping receipt.The films story is all over the place, confusing & hard to follow. The premonition sequences the main lead experiences were annoying & while creative, were repetitive to the point where you couldn't tell if she was hallucinating or actually seeing what she was seeing.The films runtime is overly long for what it is, while not as bad as other films which are generally over 2 hours (rolls eyes), this film felt longer & as I said was too long for what it was at 1 hour & 48 minutes (108 minutes) without credits & the pacing, jeez... don't get me started.The actors were alright, but what they were given script wise, didn't work & made them come across as flat. There's some action & not bad effects to be had, but that's pretty much the only redeeming features from this flick, sadly. It hasn't a lot going for it & is pretty lack luster & basic.Don't get me wrong, I prefer films with straight forward story-lines & plots you can follow, but this one was a bit too basic & could've used more meatiness to beef it up more as well as more emphasis to keep the audience engaged with the story, characters, action etc.I generally didn't like the film & the ending is just out there too & is pretty cringy like some of the scenes in the film as well as the few cringy action sequences themselves among some of the good action we got.Overall, it's a bad film. And no, it's got nothing to do with the old chestnut of me being a man who doesn't like the film because it's female lead. The film was bad & had plenty of things wrong with it. People in general, men & women, boys & girls, didn't like this flick.The story is bland, boring & paper thin like the characters & leads, the little bit of good action & effects seen are overshadowed by the aforementioned issues as well as the other issues like the poor runtime, pacing & the lacking engagement the film has.Also, for those who can't seem to get it in their heads, there's been plenty of female lead films in the past that have done well, from the Alien Franchise to The Hunger Games along with Elektra, Tomb Raider, Salt, Lucy, Hanna etc. I could go on but that's my rant for those who need calling out.2/10.","2","20 February 2024"

"alindsayal","With Marvel Studios taking on more responsibility involving Spider-Man, Sony have decided to try and build a universe involving smaller characters from the same lore as him. We have had Venom and Morbius and will get Kraven The Hunter later this year but here we have Madame Web. I saw this film last night and here is my review for Madame Web. The p[remise of the film sees a women bestowed with powers where she has to save 3 girls from being killed by a villainous foe.Main Character
I must be honest that I have never been a huge fan of Dakota Johnson and she plays Cassandra Web here and I have to be honest she isn't particularly good here. She is overacting everything here and her character is super unlikeable and hard to care about. She is clearly hampered by the awful writing in this film and she can't rise above it and give us a lead role to support or care about and Cassie Web will go down as one of the worst leads in a comic book film ever.Supporting Characters
Sydney Sweeney, Isabela Merced & Celeste O'Connor play the three girls that are in the view of the villain and they are all pretty awful. Their characters are really awkward and not particularly likeable, the film tries to force you to like and care about these characters but it comes across poorly and these actresses aren't good enough to make me care.Tahar Rahim plays Ezekiel Sims and he is one of the more frustrating parts of this film because I have seen him be a good actor and this character had some potential but the film really flops here and makes him this over the top villain that is so stupid that it really takes you out of the film.Adam Scott as Ben Parker is probably the best person here but he isn't really given much to do and it still upsets me that he plays Ben Parker and it is really clear that this was just done to provide some stupid fan service that actually annoys me even more.Story
The story is nonsensical and completely stupid. The plot makes no sense and characters do things that make no sense, Cassie Web in particular is one of the dumbest characters that I have seen in recent movies. This film also tries its best to ruin the character of Spider-Man even though he isn't in the film and it is just the backdrop to this pretty dull and horrendous adventure.Script
This is a really awfully written film. Things make no sense, characters are unlikeable and there is no humour here at all. There are so many plot holes it is crazy and the film has nothing interesting about it at all.Style
I mean I guess the action scenes are okay and the bad guys suit was okay but that is it. The film is filmed really poorly, the editing looks unfinished and at times it is actually quite jarring to watch it. There are way too many jump scares especially for a film that is not a horror film. The trailer shows things that barely happen in the film and it feels like we were sold a different film that never got made.Overall
Overall, Madame Web is a truly disastrous film. This is up there with one of the worst films I have ever seen and is up there with the worst comic book films of all time. Though I am glad I saw this film to have this experience but at all cost avoid this garbage and do something better for 2 hours.Rating - 1/10.","1","16 February 2024"
"daisukereds","A baby-sitting movie in a Superhero setting, where the lead can see the future and has to prevent NOT-Spiderman from killing teenagers (because he has dreams/visions about them). The girls run and hide around a lot, some BS happens and then the movie ends.The foundation of the script is heavily written around a hollow core of ""parents and children"". The cinematography is actually good, and at least ""teaches"" how to do CPR. It also does away with showing premonitions every time something is to be changed near the end.. respecting the viewers intelligence in at least that aspect! And it's easy to follow (if you don't fall asleep) with how simplistic it is.Aside from that, it is barely anything else..
The movie itself isn't terrible.. it's just beyond bland and boring. Also, calling this a Superhero movie is really disingenuous and a marketing ploy to get people to see it. Stay home! There are no good action sequences and nobody is written memorably....
Venom making money was a mistake. Sony has half a franchise, and they can't get anyone talented enough to do something with it. And what they continue to release seems like high-budgeted fan fiction!","3","16 February 2024"
"isaacsundaralingam","Yea, this was garbage and that's saying plenty. It's actually adorable how little anyone cared about ""Madame Web"" - not just the audience, but the filmmakers and actors themselves. Written by the same people who wrote ""Morbius"", this movie is yet another reason to not let them anywhere near a writing software ever again.Not only was the movie unwatchable due to how lifeless it was, but it was also criminally boring. You're waiting for something to happen and you keep waiting right until the credits start to roll. Nothing about the movie was compelling, the plot was riddled with plot holes, the screenplay was lazy, the dialogues were dead and the acting was almost as if the actors were held captive and being forced to act as if everything was okay. It reeks of corporate greed and there isn't a single positive thing to say about this movie.We're only a month and half into the year and we already have a very strong contender for what might be the worst movie of the year, and it's not even close. Don't watch it, but if you do indeed decide to, I hope you lived a life well enough to have a crowded funeral.","1","19 February 2024"
"syntory","Look at the profiles for the writers that wrote Madame Web. You'll see virtually every movie they've written has a bad rating and bad reviews. Why then does Hollywood continually hire these same writers for these big budget films? I could understand if they wrote movies for Asylum Films because all their movies are terrible.Madame Web is god awful! Very difficult to sit through. None of the main characters are likeable. Even the villain is lame. It seems like the entire movie was written to set up a sequel. But why would people spend money to see the sequel of a movie that is one of the worst movies ever written? I'm shocked at how bad this movie is and if there is a sequel I certainly wont bother watching it.Stop hiring bad writers, Hollywood!","2","15 February 2024"
"MovieWarfare","I would absolutely love to be in these Sony meetings because I am absolutely baffled how things like Madame Web are getting greenlit.Madame Web is one of the worst superhero movies ever made! It has terrible writing, characters, action setpieces and even acting. Dakota Johnson is so dull and boring as the main lead but this is probably down to the terrible script.To be fair, the movie does have an interesting concept with this Final Destination x Terminator thing. However, it is so poorly executed that it makes Morbius look like The Dark Knight.Anyway give me the ""He Was in the Amazon With My Mom When She Was Researching Spiders Right Before She Died"" cut!","1","17 February 2024"
"chenp-54708","Literally one of the worst superhero movies I have ever seen.From the advertisements, I knew this movie wasn't going to be great but still, it surprised me how bad and boring it was. Everything about the direction, writing, characters, technical aspects, and designs are really awful. The writing is poor as there are many concepts, ideas and aspects that are messy and bland. The messy script creates poor dialogue from the cast and the characters are not interesting. The special effects looked even worse than the marketing and all of the performances were pretty bad. I honestly do feel bad for Dakota Johnson cause she is a good actress but she deserves to have better roles then this. It can be said for the same for the rest of the cast members.The uses of product placements are annoying, action moments are dull, and and all in all, it was boring. Superhero movies shouldn't be boring but this really dragged on. It's unfortunate cause female superhero leads are something I love to see more like Wonder Woman and The Old Guard which are pretty fun. But unfortunately, it seemed that it likely isn't going to happen anytime soon.There really isn't anything else to say.Bad.","1","14 February 2024"
"AlsExGal","... when I saw Dakota Johnson was starring in it. Naturally I can't lay the entirety of this hot mess at her feet. But there is some really bad campy acting happening on her part, reminiscent of the Fifty Shades of Grey movies in which she starred. Perhaps it was because the director was more interested in the placement of Pepsi cans than her performance, but I digress.Basically, this movie plays out like the cut scenes from a budget Xbox 360 game. From the ground up this thing just feels designed to fail. It feels almost Producersesque in its approach in just how every aspect is seemingly intentionally mangled, yet no one seems to care. How have we come so full circle to go through the glory of Infinity War/Logan/The Dark Knight to arrive all the way back to Batman and Robin and Catwoman levels of superhero flicks? (Bam!, Pow!, Gosh yes Batman!)How did this movie make it so far that it has an actual release, and no one stopped it? How did this idea get green lit? Why did Sony give 80 million and turn over their valuable IP to the people that wrote Morbius, Gods of Egypt, Dracula Untold and The Last Witch Hunter? How did this get past the writing process and again have that script greenlit? How could no one on the set at any point stop things? How did no one in the editing room point out how bad it looked and how much of a mess it was?But to the suits it's not about art and story. Instead it's about business, and people are just a commodity. It's cheaper to recycle known quantities, and practice nepotism and involve maybe less than talented friends, people you've worked with before, than go out and find artists with worthy stories. They don't care about art, they don't care about stories, they care about making this work for them financially, regardless of loss of reputation with audiences as a whole.Youtuber Chris Stuckmann did a deep dive on the topic of big studios being generally run by folks who came up through management rather than the creative rungs such as writing and directing when he discussed this film. His take is worth watching. For some reason, Chris doesn't do critical movie reviews since he has become a filmmaker, but I can tell by his tone that, like me, he was completely displeased watching this one. I'd avoid it.","2","17 February 2024"
"eoinageary","This is, well I guess this is a movie in the Sony universe that I'm SHOCKED is profitable.The story is all over the place, it's basically about Madame Web who is a paramedic and develops powers and can see into the future, with a current threat she tries to change the future, teaming up with 3 powerful characters who are yet to develop into their full potential so she must shield them and change the future to protect them.Trying not to give the little story that gets told away in the opening there but i have to be vague.What I liked, one or two good scenes, I didn't mind the end, I really liked a lot of the camera work some cool looking shots and a decent Score.But the movie is BAD, it makes Morbius look like The Batman 2022. The acting is lacking, the actors look as bored as you will feel. Script is bad, just some beyond silly lines, the story chops and changes so much your neck will hurt you, some bad CGI, and just boring action.And before people harp on about ""you don't like it because it's women leads"" no, it's just a crap film, I enjoyed the marvels, Black Widow was decent, so no, the movie regardless of its leads is just poor.Extremely disappointing, 3/10.","3","14 February 2024"
"tbunker-88294","I can honestly say that once again (not that anyone is surprised) that Sony has bombed again with its superhero content. Underwhelming action, bad characters, weird dialogue, generic villain. Its just plain badI feel bad for the cast of this movie, you have EXCELLENT talent and its just wasted in this cash grab excuse of a movieSony has proved once again it can't be trusted with superhero content and has lost what little credibility it had. If the company had any integrity or wits left they should sell their share of ownership back to Marvel and let them assume FULL creative control.I'm not optimistic for Kraven The Hunter after seeing this gross disappointment.","1","14 February 2024"
"hotrobinproductions","Horrible from beginning to end, the opening scene just reeks of awful predictability from story & plot to the core. You know exactly what will happen before it even happens, the script sucks & the dialogue is even worse. There is quite noticeable audio dub edited after the fact too. This budget is 80 million, not that budget matters, because no amount of money could have saved this train wreck, but I mention this because you can still make a good film on lower budgets, Shazam, the first one, had the same budget & delt with a lot of side characters too, it's miles better, Godzilla minus one had a extremely low budget too. But this 80 million dollar film not just effects but production, feels obviously cheap, it almost feels like watching a very long pilot episode to a CW tv show.You thought Morbius was bad, that film was bad because it did the bare minimum, this film doesn't even do the bare minimum, it goes beyond comprehension below that, it just enters a point of no originality or ambition towards creating anything. There isn't even a single superhero moment, even horrible films like catwoman or Morbius has superhero moments & action, this thing doesn't, you get instead visions of the future to potentially set up sequels.This movie also has a serious problem of product placement, it's a long commercial, to be exact a long Pepsi commercial, I feel like Pepsi stopped the halftime show so they could invest in the product placement in this film. This movie was more important to them than the superbowl LOL it's just so over the top & obviously placed way too much in this film. Calvin Klein, Chase bank, the list goes on. This movie should be called superhero product placement the movie.It's barely even close to a 1/10 the cool moments are seeing what we already saw in the trailer when she's seeing the future & you think it's happening now but then it goes back to the moment she realizes it's a vision, granted it's cool the first couple times but it gets old REAL quick. & it ends up getting annoying because it's abused way too much.Thats about it, there isn't any redeeming things in this film, the acting isn't even good. I would say the 3 side character spider women that Dakota finds when they are together there was a potential spark. I saw the talent & potential, but they are failed big time by such a horrid script that the spark never even sparks, it's just like showing you the matches & gasoline & not setting the fire.Madame M0RBIUS / 10.","1","16 February 2024"
"olcare","It's the worst movie and superhero adaptation I've watched in recent years. Completely atrocious effects, atrocious screenplay, and atrocious acting. Also, a big insult to all comic book readers and those who know the original story.Let me describe the movie simply. First of all, I am filled with hatred; I really want to curse the entire creative team for this unacceptable film.All the performances are bad, everyone. There's not a single good actor trying; everyone just took the role for money. It's a terrible disgrace, a total eclipse of reason.The screenplay is the worst superhero screenplay I've ever seen. It barely resembles the original story, and if there aren't scenes like the other Spider-Girls in the trailer, why include them? There's no such obligation; instead, write a decent screenplay. All action scenes are full of logical errors; they've written it without thinking, it's complete garbage.Apart from these, the direction, sorry to say, is garbage too. Most scenes are shot as if they were taken straight from a phone camera; action scenes are not shown, they're hidden due to the atrociousness of the effects. It's shameful.After these general points, Sony urgently needs to cancel this universe; the original stories are garbage, there's no logic, no connection anywhere. They're just being shot randomly. I don't like to curse, but I hope this film sinks at the box office.The last scene with Madame Web gaining her powers, those web effects, clinging to souls, it's unbelievable how you approved this film, may God punish you.I don't know which one to talk about; all the atrocities are collected in this film. Whether it's the woman going to Peru and back in 30 seconds, Spider-Man dodging with fireworks, dancing at the boys' table when my daughters are left alone, not telling the story of the Spider-Human community, or the woman talking normally while giving birth at the end, everything is a disgrace. I hope this universe sinks, and you all get fired. No one involved in the management of this film deserves their job respectfully; they should quit immediately.Note: Dakota Johnson made a statement saying she didn't watch the movie. Why are you serving a completely garbage film if you're not going to watch it? Life shouldn't be all about money for you; we, in our poverty, are trying to watch it, and this is no different from cursing all the audience's families. Shame on you.Note 2: Just now, I looked at the budget of the movie, and my anger grew even more, 80 million dollars EIGHTY MILLION. How can I not believe this money, I really can't believe it, it's nothing but disrespect to yourself, disrespect to the audience, nothing but an insult.","1","16 February 2024"
"sinscopefilms","First Impression:The opening of the Madame Web was immersed in a mystique and ambition, enhanced by great musical score; yet, as the movie progresses, it becomes a mixed bag and a rollercoaster of emotions.The Positive:Musical Score and Sound Design: The standout feature of ""Madame Web"" is its musical score. The soundtrack not only enhances the emotional depth of the film but also succeeds in creating in some moments genuine goosebumps. The sound design really enhances this impact by carefully using sound pans, bass, and reverse effects. It creates a sense of tension and immersion which is one of the film's strongest features.The Mixed:Visual Effects and Costume Design: Some of the visual effects in ""Madame Web"" were visually appealing. The costume design, like Casey's red jacket and the three spider girl villain outfits standing out as particularly stunning contributions to the film's aesthetic, but it was not often shown in the film since the films direction and focus was different. I was disappointed.Acting and Direction: Although I thought Casey's character development - her ability to see the world from a different perspective - was great, I didn't like how it was visually presented. The way it was edited was poorly done. The editor could use 2 distinct color grading features where one sees the future and two, she sees the present moment.However, The performances throughout the film feel lackluster, with the actors appearing confused and disengaged. This, combined with direction that fails to maintain interest or coherence in many scenes, significantly undermines the film's potential.Negatives:Cinematography: Cinematography is bad since some pictures don't show a clear image. The camera moves so fast that I cannot comprehend the picture. I kind of recognized that it tries to initiate the rapidness of the events from the spider's eye point of view but it was a tasteless decision. The Cinematography is not something like wow. The reason why Cinematography was lacking is because it was heavily based on medium closeups and dutch tilts which on one hand was a unique choice but on the other hand very hard to watch. I found the 180 degree round camera rotations super cool, but again, I expected varied distance shots, not just medium shots. The train scene Cinematography was the best in the film.Editing and Pace: The editing is arguably the weakest element of ""Madame Web,"" with its rapid cuts and disjointed flow detracting significantly from the storytelling. This lack of coherence makes it challenging for the audience to fully engage with the narrative.Plot and Overall Execution: The storyline of ""Madame Web"" is cluttered and clichéd, suffering from a lack of originality and clear direction. The film's ambition is evident, but the execution falls short of creating a compelling narrative.The Conclusion:""Madame Web"" presents a paradoxical experience, with exceptional music and sound design standing that sharply contrasts with its various flaws in editing, cinematography, and direction.Although there are some visually and emotionally stunning moments, they are frequently overshadowed by a lack of coherence and clarity.Also, I think this film would be reasonable and great to be incorporated in a TV series which would have allowed for a more in-depth exploration of characters and plot.Nevertheless, Madame Web is a bit of a mixed bag, with moments of potential that ultimately leave the viewer something different visually.Rating: 3/10.","3","15 February 2024"
"Skruffbagg","Cannon, is that you in disguise?I firmly believe Madame Web will go down in history as not only the worst superhero movie, but also one of the worst movies ever made. It's that bad. It's absolutely fascinating to behold.Now, I'll be honest with you here. I only went to see this because I had heard it was an unmitigated disaster that had to be seen to be believed, and it truly does not disappoint - or massively does, depending on your viewpoint.It takes a special kind of director to get such cringe-inducing performances out of a fairly talented cast (Dakota Johnson and Tahar Rahim are both quality actors with the right script and direction), but SJ Clarkson somehow manages to wrangle the absolute worst imaginable from every single person in the film. I'll be very surprised if she ever does another feature after this.Nothing in this film works; the plot is moronic, the script seems like it was written by a teenager, the cinematography is horrendous, the aformentioned embarrassing performances, the audio editing is baffling (so much dubbing, brain-melting music choices). I'm amazed this didn't get shelved the minute the final cut was done.To me, I rate this as ""so bad it's good"" as I wasn't bored watching it, but most people I assume will say it's just plain bad... and it is, but very entertainingly so.If you love watching a 2hr car crash then I highly recommend this. The awfulness is mind-boggling in it's complexity, but in the best possible way. Film scholars and historians will be analysing this movie for years to come, and I hope it is talked about in the same vein as The Room in the future.An absolutely epic misfire on all levels.","1","20 February 2024"
"MiroslavKyuranov","It's astonishing to think that Sony could put out a worse product than 2022's Morbius, but boy, ""Madame Web"" manages it. It is an embarrassing mess. Talented stars wasted on probably one of the worst comic book movie ever (which nobody asked for). Filled with atrocious dialogue, awkward editing and laughable structure. It's a clunky, poorly-written, messy, and sloppy movie packed with some mediocre editing and performances.The concept is interesting on paper, but it couldn't be saved due to it's terrible execution. ""Madame Web"" simply lacked the spark it needed in nearly every dept.There is simply nothing memorable in this movie, except maybe some superhero costumes, but that doesn't redeem the fact that the movie is bad.So yeah...""Madame Web"" is yet another disappointing entry in the Sony's Spider-Less universe. It's like a love letter to an era of superhero films that people largely want to forget. The ""Pepsi"" adds are stand-out, it falls short of what could have been a decent movie in the hands of someone else twenty years ago.","4","14 February 2024"
"darrelltill","There is nothing good in this film. It's badly written - not just full of clichés but full of dialogue that is meant to sound like cliché superhero idioms yet butchered until they make no sense. It is nothing but a costume parade with players that are dead behind the eyes. You can tell that everybody involved knows it's going to be a stinker but they'd already signed on and it was too late. It would be great if this was the flop that made Disney rethink their output (I know, this is actually an SSU movie not an MCU movie, but they are all heading down the same path) but I fear it will take a few more. The solution is really simple - they need to adjust their hiring policy to include persons of talent.","1","15 February 2024"
"movieman6-413-929510","Madame Web is a new spin-off set in the Marvel Spider-Man world. This spin-off is directed, partly written and produced by S. J. Clarkson. Before this film, she directed more TV series episodes of superhero shows such as Jessica Jones and The Defenders.Cassandra Webb (Dakota Johnson) works as a paramedic in New York and learns after an accident that she has superpowers to see future possibilities. She sees that the lives of three girls are threatened by a mysterious masked man with spider-like powers.This is why she tries to protect the three girls and must convince them that their lives are really in danger. To truly protect them, they must ensure that the three listen to her and learn to work together.The story of this film has an interesting concept, but the final story and screenplay were written by five different writers. These writers do not always seem to have been on the same page, because the story sometimes seems a bit rushed or frayed. It sometimes seems as if they didn't really know what exactly to do with it, or what the film studio despised of them. The screenplay has also been rewritten many times, so the cast members could no longer always follow exactly where they were going or supposed to do with the film.Despite these messy, rushed aspects, the film remains on a familiar, predictable side for a superhero film. This can make the film seem a bit long-winded or embarrassing. The film is reminiscent of other superhero films that came out around the year 2000, but of a somewhat lesser quality.The visual effects don't always look believable either. The blue screen and CGI can be seen in the film. For some of the cast members, this was also the first time they had actually worked in a film with such visual effects. The fact that they have little or no experience with these film situations is sometimes reflected in their acting.The poor script also gives the cast members few opportunities to make something special of their roles. Dakota Johnson also seemed a bit uncomfortable during promotions of the film, or ignorant of how to properly promote this film. In the final film she tries to make the best of the role and tries to add some comedy to the role, but she doesn't always get the chance to do this. Sydney Sweeney, Isabela Merced and Celeste O'Connor play the three girls Cassandra tries to protect. All three are given a little time to give their characters some personalities, but unfortunately not enough to make you as a viewer really care about the three. For a better focused film, they might have been better off using a character in the story, who Cassandra then has to protect. Tahar Rahim plays the villain in the film, who tries to kill the three girls, but also deals with the poor, weak script. As a result, he does not emerge as strongly as the villain of the story. They also didn't incorporate his audio work well into the film, because his lips sometimes don't always match what his character is saying.With all these superhero spin-off films from the Sony film studio, they only make Marvel's current film series more messy. If Sony and Disney Marvel try to collaborate on the same film series, they will have to consult each other more and better and plan where they want to go with this film series.","2","17 February 2024"
"ethanbresnett","Based on Madame Web's woeful reviews I was expecting this film to be an utter car crash. To its credit I will say it isn't entirely without merit, but it is incredibly boring and bland.Mostly this is because nothing particularly happens. It's a superhero movie with little to no superhero action and a painfully long set up for an underwhelming final act. The characters are so underdeveloped that there is no emotional connection or investment in any of them. Everything about the story and writing just feels lazy, vacuous and corny.Then there's the villain who is utterly uninspiring. He is constantly complaining about 'everything he has built' being destroyed. What has he built you might ask? The film has no interest in exploring this question. He's easily one of the more two dimensional and weak superhero villains I've ever seen committed to screen.Perhaps the most heinous crime this movie commits is to waste the talents of Dakota Johnson, Sydney Sweeney, Adam Scott, Emma Roberts, Zosia Mamet and more. Such a good cast was assembled and they were given absolutely nothing to work with, so I don't blame the performers. It's just such a shame to see such great talent put to the sword like this.As if all of this wasn't enough, the movie also feels remarkably low budget and feels excruciatingly long despite its relatively short runtime.Ultimately I think this film suffered because it was clearly intended as a set up for a wider Spider-Woman franchise which is unlikely to come to fruition. There seemed to be no interest in making a good stand alone movie, and no respect for the audience. A massive waste of time.","3","21 February 2024"
"vfphvnpp","I understand what the plan was here. They wanted a trippy film, focusing on a strong future for the Sony verse. The problem is the delivery. The camera work in this movie made it quite irritating to follow, as there was constant quick close up shots of the action. The dialogue was awful, and there was quite a lot of blatant voice over during the villain scenes.So much wasted time was given to boring scenes in the movie, which led me to believe the screen writers finished the script and realised that it was under the word count.Honestly the acting quality was quite poor across the board, especially the villain, who honestly seems as if they didn't cast for his role at all, just picked up someone off the side of the road.For someone who's guilty pleasure is watching bad movies, I it was a painful time. Don't recommend.","2","14 February 2024"
"jtorch-11283","Don't waste your time, and money seeing this in theaters. I was fooled by the trailer which looked promising. All the action in the whole film ( a total of 2 scenes) is shown in the the trailer. The rest of the movie is just terrible acting trying to save an even worse scrip.I'm honestly not sure how this made it to the big screen. I'm not a cinema expert, but shouldn't someone have to view the finished product and give the O. K. At some point before it is ""audience ready?"" I feel like that step in the process was skipped. I don't know what Marvel had to do with this film, but it certainly isn't the Iron-Man-Marvel I keep hoping they will somehow revive.And to whom it may concern, ""my parents don't love me.""

"cosby_don","I don't know where to start-actually, I do! THIS IS THE WORST MOVIE IN THE HISTORY OF HUMANITY. I'm not kidding.I'm not sure what other movie this Dakota Johnson has been in, but after watching THIS movie, I'll probably never support her again. This was an absolute career killer. Ms. Johnson, please FIRE your agent immediately.To the production crew, editors, director, and ESPECIALLY the writers (I counted 4 writers-that's RIDICULOUS), shame on you for contributing to this mess. It's obvious you've traded in your morals for a paycheck. That's Hollywood for ya'.Did I mention that this movie was HORRENDOUSLY bad?

"rgkarim","LIKES:The Commentary At Times
-Some lines in this movie are startling at how funny they were for me, a fantastic bout of teenage emotions with a less than thrilled babysitter.-Madame Web's origin story is almost like an anti-hero tale to Charles Xavier idea, and though it's not fully fleshed out, there is emotion, fun, and what felt natural angst and vulnerability into it.-With the right timing, and build up, this section of commentary was a striking positive in this reviewers book.Representation of Paramedics
-It's a rare thing to get to actually see E. M. T's in their work and what they give to serve the public.-While a bit forced, and perhaps a tad overdone and cheesy, kudos for Madame Web accomplishing some detailed shots of them serving the public and giving a little character development with it.-There were great avenues taken to help ingrain parts into the story, and with that, the medical nerd inside me found a cool little nod in those sequences.Some Artistic Visuals Are Cool
-I'm a sucker for a good shot and a good artistic visual popping out and ingraining itself into my mind.-Madame Web has some of these moments for me, the creepy and yet serene world of the Web World, being one that holds majesty and mystery, but also the very emotions of the person trying to wield it.-Other shots of costume crusaders striking that right pose, or perhaps that nostalgic early 2000s look, really help establish some of the themes of the movie or a good set up visual to cascade into.-It may be sprinkled about, but there were some superhero visuals that accomplished the job for me in Madame Web.Talented Cast
-Celeste O'Connor is very fun in this movie. A tad quirky, but she keeps the attitude going, a lot of that sass very fun and usually well-placed to help move the story towards forced comedy and obvious story telling.-Merced eventually grew on me after she got into the meat of her character and starting to push past the stubborn and cheeky attitude. She's got charming charisma, a fun brainy side to exploit, and this sadness that she uses to illicit such emotion, something I wanted more of, but got only little.-Sweeney is fun in this movie. Toned down from the other roles I've seen, the woman knows how to adapt her style and give me something to hook to several times. I love the awkwardness she brings, the tie in to the two extremes, and her surprising smallness after she plays such big roles.-And Johnson is about the same as she always is. A snarky and condescending nature that she wields expertly, but a tad dry at times that some lines feel unfulfilled. Fortunately, she's got good chemistry with the girls that assisted in smoothing out the faults.Some Surprising Character Arcs
-The movie may miss a lot of things, but there are a few moments that work very well to show the potential of Madame Web if given the right focus.-An opening that holds some merit was one of the victories, something that would eventually bleed into plot points further on that gave you a very touching moment.-And another element has the other's origin stories granting us some potential hurt and relatable tales to latch onto and acknowledge. Again, helping give a young and in your face Charlie's Angel group some vim and vigor.The Music
-Call me a sucker for nostalgia, Madame Web has a mix of songs that were perfect for viewers like me to enjoy.-Comedic use of the songs are not the most creative, but add that minor element to help give the girls a little more dynamic and believability.-While other times, it's just a blast of the speakers and me dancing in my seat as the forgotten wonder returns for another run to get things started.DISLIKES:The Pacing Uneven
-Despite the trinkets and some merits to the story, Madame Web's dislikes for me start with the pacing of the tale.-A moderately slow start did little to keep me engaged, only to then have these sprints of faster moments to try to change things up, before hitting the brakes again.-Like a CW season crammed into one, Madame Web's pacing feels a lot like dressed up teenage drama trying to give realism and gradual steps, but really just being the mashup of the uglier time use dramas can get stuck to.The Stale Mechanic
-From the trailers, you know there is some type of vision gimmick that Cassie is supposed to use to protect her charges.-That gimmick gets stale very quickly for a viewer like me, the convoluted presentation starting out fun at first, but then turning into annoying déjà vu that felt more like reshoots than actual artistic twisting.-Like Moon Knight, that element makes sense at first, but really could have stopped halfway through the movie once the viewers has connected the powers.-Had there been a bit more excitement, fighting, or even better storytelling to distract, it would have been less impactful, but alas, for me, all the other limitations added up.Lack of Other Character Development
-There are a lot of characters in this movie, some played by bigger names than the leads themselves. And yet, their time and character development felt shoehorned than planned out.-Adam Scott and Emma Roberts seem disengaged, with stories that are cliché, simplistic, and a waste of talent that again showed potential with that slower pacing at the start.-But even the villain and main girls tales feel very bland, and that lack of character development was very much felt by me that it almost seems to rely heavily on another movie to do these characters justice.Annoying Dialogue
-I know, I said the commentary was good, but that was a small amount of it compared to the whole.-Madame Web's dialogue seems to have gone through the writing grinder several times, very loaded with one liners, sassy comments and attitude that seemed to be out of place for much of the film for me.-Statements of the obvious, corny dialogue essentially pushed in with too simplistic of writing and in your face, overdramatic flair to count as quality dialogue. It needs tuning up, needs to be less forceful, and try to add a little Hollywood magic to help tenderize it to something matching a comic book movie.A Villain Needing A Lot More
-Don't get me wrong, there is an element to him that is relatable, believable, and indeed threatening in terms of the madness of his actions.-But outside of this and the opening scene, Ezekiel is a very bland bad guy who just didn't get the time to shine outside of crawling and repeating the same lines over and over.-The direction failed to give him any recognizable skills, his threats empty most of the time and sort of creepy obsessive, and dare I say his actual character is zoomed over and practically absent but for the opening line.-To me, that's a limited villain and one major flaw that much of the movie suffers from.Visuals Get Really Muddy/Bad
-Sony makes such great looking video games, and yet their movies still suffer from last gen effects
-While the artistic flair of those moments was enjoyable, they did have that faux effect that dropped some of the realism this movie was going for.-Even worse, there are lots of movements, character renderings, and powers that leave a lot to be desired in looking their best. I won't say it's a dealbreaker, but it doesn't help to have such limited technology presentation.Scenes/Story Seem Very Chopped Up
-Between the gimmicks and pacing, the scenes already feel limited, messy, and almost like an abbreviated version of what they could be.-Sure, the dialogue gives you everything they are going for, but the presentation felt very much like a lot of reshoots of the same scene, and slight changes that made little difference.-Such indecisive direction and edits got away from them and left me just wondering what this film could have been with half the gimmicks of the visions pulled back.The Action Is Very Boring
-No denying this, Madame Web maybe even worse than many of the CW attempts at action.-While witty, and an amusing game of cat and mouse, a Spiderverse without a solid one or two fights is a verse I'm not fond playing in for nearly two hours.-A lame villain does little but strut and crawl, while our cast somehow running away and eluding comes off a bit pathetic than entertaining.-Even the climax is a mess, rushed finishes, suspense of disbelief, and an overdramatic battle of words with a very extravagant and mushy ending to cap it off.-Eternals at least had a few moves that had me rocking in my seat, but this... this was a challenge to stay awake in.The VERDICT:
Madame Web is certainly not the worst movie I've seen in years, but that doesn't mean Sony's latest is a masterpiece either. There are elements of this vision that show the potential for a good future, but need a lot of work to make up for this rushed installment. A talented cast, music and some fun writing can be the starting building blocks, but it can't offset what feels like lots of production limitations, rewrites, and editing that greatly show in this movie. Boring battles, annoying gimmicks, and under developed characters despite a strong cast were just some of the limitations this movie has to work through if a series is to come with it.

"eddie_baggins","I'm not ashamed to admit I've seen some movies in my time.I am however ashamed to admit curiosity got the better of me and I ended up in an almost entirely empty cinema screening (thanks to one tolerant movie buddy who joined me on my trip to the local cinema) partaking in what can only be described as one of the most universally panned Hollywood blockbusters of the modern era.Not at all interested in watching another Sony Marvel outing after their last few efforts, hearing about the insanely awesome awfulness of Madame Web from friends, internet identities and esteemed critics made me want to witness a potential all-time cringe-fest and while when people are absolutely right in their hyperbole around just how bad Madame Web is, I'm still trying to comprehend how I could possibly testify to just how bad things are here.Directed by long time TV episode director S. J. Clarkson and featuring a cast of performers who have all proven over time to be more than capable of bringing the goods, Madame Web is not devoid of talent that may have been able to salvage some type of goodness from an offence against the entire cinematic medium but as a finished? (Honestly I am unsure how anyone could claim this is an acceptable final version, just watch for some of the most flawed examples of ADR you're ever going to see) product there was no one or any thing that could've saved this nightmare from the fate it had created for itself.An experience that could only possibly come from a collective group who all gave up the fight to save it long before shooting had wrapped, Madame Web inexcusably comes from the same penmanship that was guilty of unleashing Morbius on us but screenwriters Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless at least managed to find some cult like goodness in Jared Leto and Matt Smith's wildly OTT characters and bizarre action segments but Madame Web is nothing more than two hours of terrible plot, characters, spectacle and intentions and there is quite literally no valid reason for this movie to exist in the form it has been given.One of the most atrociously acted Hollywood films ever captured, with lead Dakota Johnson unable to hold back her disdain for a film she clearly hated being a part of and poor old Tahar Rahim taking the films most unfortunate mantle from a wigged Sydney Sweeney, Madame Web may have been promoted as some type of intense action thriller following the exploits of Johnson's Cassandra Webb as she battles Rahim's Ezekiel Sims alongside Sweeney's Julia, Isabela Merced's Anya and Celeste O'Connor's Mattie but we get something else entirely that is hard to come to terms with.From some of the most detestable and frequent examples of product placement that becomes instantly iconic (some viewers may find themselves attempting to crack open a Pepsi can in their Calvin Klein's after a viewing), a villain we literally know nothing about with zero attempts to bother explaining his plans or background, an embarrassing use of comic staple characters that aren't even put into action outside of dream sequences and a script that must surely have been conjured on ChatGPT, Madame Web is a cesspool of Hollywood excrement that isn't even funny in its horribleness, just merely sad and depressing.The only justifiable reason for Madame Web to be the film it is as it stands is if Sony are deliberately attempting to sabotage their Marvel property that no longer is allowed to include many fan favourites, if they aren't in fact doing that there is zero excuses for why Madame Web has ever been allowed to be birthed into existence.An irredeemable, amateurish and embarrassing exercise in pointless, Madame Web is a shockingly bad example of blockbuster filmmaking that is the exact type of bottom feeder product the cinema industry and the Marvel brand didn't need at this particular point of time.Final Say -If you're a glutton for punishment and want to be reminded of everything you wouldn't wish to see in a supposed piece of big screen entertainment then Madame Web is for you! A truly iconic new addition to the staples of all-time misfires, nothing could prepare one for the garbage that is this $80 million dollar disasterpiece.0 fireworks to the head out of 5.Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)","1","22 February 2024"
"shaikhirshad-41223","Literally I had zero expectations when I went to watch this flick but I still thought that something should be good in this to watch at least one time because of marvel name in it. But this movie is so low and looks like low budget CGI thriller and a comedy in the name of superhero genre.I mean from the start itself movie lost it's pace and story and god only knows what are they showing no interest in the screenplay and the plot is not even engaging to watch for at least 30 mins.I only went for Dakota & Sydney just because the screen presence of them looks good, but the director loss this opportunity too. Because the character they're playing is so bad and not even proper dialogues are given and just they have made a common character with no story arc just the situation that they have to act
I've never seen such a bad cinematography of any film it looks like they don't have any interest making this film so they just made a spoof just to show that we are making a movie. Don't know what to say more because this film is that bad.Overall a Boring fest and a spoof fo a superhero genre.","2","16 February 2024"
"vengeance20","Ok, so before people come at me with the ""YoU dIdN't LiKe It BeCaUsE iT wAs FeMaLe LeAd."" chestnut. I went into this one with an open mind, but expecting it to be as described & the reviews were right. The film is bad.The film sees Cassandra Webb who is a New York metropolis paramedic who begins to demonstrate signs of clairvoyance. Forced to challenge revelations about her past, she needs to safeguard 3 young girls from a deadly adversary who wants them destroyed.I found the film to be pretty bad. It's disjointed, clunky, poorly paced & just feels very awkward & stiff. The characters are personality-less, they look & sound as if they're reciting their lines from cue cards (almost robotic, I might add) & the script reads like a supermarket shopping receipt.The films story is all over the place, confusing & hard to follow. The premonition sequences the main lead experiences were annoying & while creative, were repetitive to the point where you couldn't tell if she was hallucinating or actually seeing what she was seeing.The films runtime is overly long for what it is, while not as bad as other films which are generally over 2 hours (rolls eyes), this film felt longer & as I said was too long for what it was at 1 hour & 48 minutes (108 minutes) without credits & the pacing, jeez... don't get me started.The actors were alright, but what they were given script wise, didn't work & made them come across as flat. There's some action & not bad effects to be had, but that's pretty much the only redeeming features from this flick, sadly. It hasn't a lot going for it & is pretty lack luster & basic.Don't get me wrong, I prefer films with straight forward story-lines & plots you can follow, but this one was a bit too basic & could've used more meatiness to beef it up more as well as more emphasis to keep the audience engaged with the story, characters, action etc.I generally didn't like the film & the ending is just out there too & is pretty cringy like some of the scenes in the film as well as the few cringy action sequences themselves among some of the good action we got.Overall, it's a bad film. And no, it's got nothing to do with the old chestnut of me being a man who doesn't like the film because it's female lead. The film was bad & had plenty of things wrong with it. People in general, men & women, boys & girls, didn't like this flick.The story is bland, boring & paper thin like the characters & leads, the little bit of good action & effects seen are overshadowed by the aforementioned issues as well as the other issues like the poor runtime, pacing & the lacking engagement the film has.Also, for those who can't seem to get it in their heads, there's been plenty of female lead films in the past that have done well, from the Alien Franchise to The Hunger Games along with Elektra, Tomb Raider, Salt, Lucy, Hanna etc. I could go on but that's my rant for those who need calling out.2/10.","2","20 February 2024"
"izadyardariush","I could tell from the beginning, making this movie was a bad idea. After I saw the cast I could tell this movie doomed. I have nothing against any of those actors but I must say casting a Dakota was a biggest mistake for the role! Anyone read the comics could say that. This movie was like terminator meeting final destination! No good story, big mess, lot of waste of potentials. I must say worst choice of villain!

"alindsayal","With Marvel Studios taking on more responsibility involving Spider-Man, Sony have decided to try and build a universe involving smaller characters from the same lore as him. We have had Venom and Morbius and will get Kraven The Hunter later this year but here we have Madame Web. I saw this film last night and here is my review for Madame Web. The p[remise of the film sees a women bestowed with powers where she has to save 3 girls from being killed by a villainous foe.Main Character
I must be honest that I have never been a huge fan of Dakota Johnson and she plays Cassandra Web here and I have to be honest she isn't particularly good here. She is overacting everything here and her character is super unlikeable and hard to care about. She is clearly hampered by the awful writing in this film and she can't rise above it and give us a lead role to support or care about and Cassie Web will go down as one of the worst leads in a comic book film ever.Supporting Characters
Sydney Sweeney, Isabela Merced & Celeste O'Connor play the three girls that are in the view of the villain and they are all pretty awful. Their characters are really awkward and not particularly likeable, the film tries to force you to like and care about these characters but it comes across poorly and these actresses aren't good enough to make me care.Tahar Rahim plays Ezekiel Sims and he is one of the more frustrating parts of this film because I have seen him be a good actor and this character had some potential but the film really flops here and makes him this over the top villain that is so stupid that it really takes you out of the film.Adam Scott as Ben Parker is probably the best person here but he isn't really given much to do and it still upsets me that he plays Ben Parker and it is really clear that this was just done to provide some stupid fan service that actually annoys me even more.Story
The story is nonsensical and completely stupid. The plot makes no sense and characters do things that make no sense, Cassie Web in particular is one of the dumbest characters that I have seen in recent movies. This film also tries its best to ruin the character of Spider-Man even though he isn't in the film and it is just the backdrop to this pretty dull and horrendous adventure.Script
This is a really awfully written film. Things make no sense, characters are unlikeable and there is no humour here at all. There are so many plot holes it is crazy and the film has nothing interesting about it at all.Style
I mean I guess the action scenes are okay and the bad guys suit was okay but that is it. The film is filmed really poorly, the editing looks unfinished and at times it is actually quite jarring to watch it. There are way too many jump scares especially for a film that is not a horror film. The trailer shows things that barely happen in the film and it feels like we were sold a different film that never got made.Overall
Overall, Madame Web is a truly disastrous film. This is up there with one of the worst films I have ever seen and is up there with the worst comic book films of all time. Though I am glad I saw this film to have this experience but at all cost avoid this garbage and do something better for 2 hours.Rating - 1/10.","1","16 February 2024"
"daisukereds","A baby-sitting movie in a Superhero setting, where the lead can see the future and has to prevent NOT-Spiderman from killing teenagers (because he has dreams/visions about them). The girls run and hide around a lot, some BS happens and then the movie ends.The foundation of the script is heavily written around a hollow core of ""parents and children"". The cinematography is actually good, and at least ""teaches"" how to do CPR. It also does away with showing premonitions every time something is to be changed near the end.. respecting the viewers intelligence in at least that aspect! And it's easy to follow (if you don't fall asleep) with how simplistic it is.Aside from that, it is barely anything else..
The movie itself isn't terrible.. it's just beyond bland and boring. Also, calling this a Superhero movie is really disingenuous and a marketing ploy to get people to see it. Stay home! There are no good action sequences and nobody is written memorably....
Venom making money was a mistake. Sony has half a franchise, and they can't get anyone talented enough to do something with it. And what they continue to release seems like high-budgeted fan fiction!","3","16 February 2024"
"isaacsundaralingam","Yea, this was garbage and that's saying plenty. It's actually adorable how little anyone cared about ""Madame Web"" - not just the audience, but the filmmakers and actors themselves. Written by the same people who wrote ""Morbius"", this movie is yet another reason to not let them anywhere near a writing software ever again.Not only was the movie unwatchable due to how lifeless it was, but it was also criminally boring. You're waiting for something to happen and you keep waiting right until the credits start to roll. Nothing about the movie was compelling, the plot was riddled with plot holes, the screenplay was lazy, the dialogues were dead and the acting was almost as if the actors were held captive and being forced to act as if everything was okay. It reeks of corporate greed and there isn't a single positive thing to say about this movie.We're only a month and half into the year and we already have a very strong contender for what might be the worst movie of the year, and it's not even close. Don't watch it, but if you do indeed decide to, I hope you lived a life well enough to have a crowded funeral.","1","19 February 2024"
"syntory","Look at the profiles for the writers that wrote Madame Web. You'll see virtually every movie they've written has a bad rating and bad reviews. Why then does Hollywood continually hire these same writers for these big budget films? I could understand if they wrote movies for Asylum Films because all their movies are terrible.Madame Web is god awful! Very difficult to sit through. None of the main characters are likeable. Even the villain is lame. It seems like the entire movie was written to set up a sequel. But why would people spend money to see the sequel of a movie that is one of the worst movies ever written? I'm shocked at how bad this movie is and if there is a sequel I certainly wont bother watching it.Stop hiring bad writers, Hollywood!","2","15 February 2024"
"MovieWarfare","I would absolutely love to be in these Sony meetings because I am absolutely baffled how things like Madame Web are getting greenlit.Madame Web is one of the worst superhero movies ever made! It has terrible writing, characters, action setpieces and even acting. Dakota Johnson is so dull and boring as the main lead but this is probably down to the terrible script.To be fair, the movie does have an interesting concept with this Final Destination x Terminator thing. However, it is so poorly executed that it makes Morbius look like The Dark Knight.Anyway give me the ""He Was in the Amazon With My Mom When She Was Researching Spiders Right Before She Died"" cut!","1","17 February 2024"
"chenp-54708","Literally one of the worst superhero movies I have ever seen.From the advertisements, I knew this movie wasn't going to be great but still, it surprised me how bad and boring it was. Everything about the direction, writing, characters, technical aspects, and designs are really awful. The writing is poor as there are many concepts, ideas and aspects that are messy and bland. The messy script creates poor dialogue from the cast and the characters are not interesting. The special effects looked even worse than the marketing and all of the performances were pretty bad. I honestly do feel bad for Dakota Johnson cause she is a good actress but she deserves to have better roles then this. It can be said for the same for the rest of the cast members.The uses of product placements are annoying, action moments are dull, and and all in all, it was boring. Superhero movies shouldn't be boring but this really dragged on. It's unfortunate cause female superhero leads are something I love to see more like Wonder Woman and The Old Guard which are pretty fun. But unfortunately, it seemed that it likely isn't going to happen anytime soon.There really isn't anything else to say.Bad.","1","14 February 2024"
"AlsExGal","... when I saw Dakota Johnson was starring in it. Naturally I can't lay the entirety of this hot mess at her feet. But there is some really bad campy acting happening on her part, reminiscent of the Fifty Shades of Grey movies in which she starred. Perhaps it was because the director was more interested in the placement of Pepsi cans than her performance, but I digress.Basically, this movie plays out like the cut scenes from a budget Xbox 360 game. From the ground up this thing just feels designed to fail. It feels almost Producersesque in its approach in just how every aspect is seemingly intentionally mangled, yet no one seems to care. How have we come so full circle to go through the glory of Infinity War/Logan/The Dark Knight to arrive all the way back to Batman and Robin and Catwoman levels of superhero flicks? (Bam!, Pow!, Gosh yes Batman!)How did this movie make it so far that it has an actual release, and no one stopped it? How did this idea get green lit? Why did Sony give 80 million and turn over their valuable IP to the people that wrote Morbius, Gods of Egypt, Dracula Untold and The Last Witch Hunter? How did this get past the writing process and again have that script greenlit? How could no one on the set at any point stop things? How did no one in the editing room point out how bad it looked and how much of a mess it was?But to the suits it's not about art and story. Instead it's about business, and people are just a commodity. It's cheaper to recycle known quantities, and practice nepotism and involve maybe less than talented friends, people you've worked with before, than go out and find artists with worthy stories. They don't care about art, they don't care about stories, they care about making this work for them financially, regardless of loss of reputation with audiences as a whole.Youtuber Chris Stuckmann did a deep dive on the topic of big studios being generally run by folks who came up through management rather than the creative rungs such as writing and directing when he discussed this film. His take is worth watching. For some reason, Chris doesn't do critical movie reviews since he has become a filmmaker, but I can tell by his tone that, like me, he was completely displeased watching this one. I'd avoid it.","2","17 February 2024"
"eoinageary","This is, well I guess this is a movie in the Sony universe that I'm SHOCKED is profitable.The story is all over the place, it's basically about Madame Web who is a paramedic and develops powers and can see into the future, with a current threat she tries to change the future, teaming up with 3 powerful characters who are yet to develop into their full potential so she must shield them and change the future to protect them.Trying not to give the little story that gets told away in the opening there but i have to be vague.What I liked, one or two good scenes, I didn't mind the end, I really liked a lot of the camera work some cool looking shots and a decent Score.But the movie is BAD, it makes Morbius look like The Batman 2022. The acting is lacking, the actors look as bored as you will feel. Script is bad, just some beyond silly lines, the story chops and changes so much your neck will hurt you, some bad CGI, and just boring action.And before people harp on about ""you don't like it because it's women leads"" no, it's just a crap film, I enjoyed the marvels, Black Widow was decent, so no, the movie regardless of its leads is just poor.Extremely disappointing, 3/10.","3","14 February 2024"

"hotrobinproductions","Horrible from beginning to end, the opening scene just reeks of awful predictability from story & plot to the core. You know exactly what will happen before it even happens, the script sucks & the dialogue is even worse. There is quite noticeable audio dub edited after the fact too. This budget is 80 million, not that budget matters, because no amount of money could have saved this train wreck, but I mention this because you can still make a good film on lower budgets, Shazam, the first one, had the same budget & delt with a lot of side characters too, it's miles better, Godzilla minus one had a extremely low budget too. But this 80 million dollar film not just effects but production, feels obviously cheap, it almost feels like watching a very long pilot episode to a CW tv show.You thought Morbius was bad, that film was bad because it did the bare minimum, this film doesn't even do the bare minimum, it goes beyond comprehension below that, it just enters a point of no originality or ambition towards creating anything. There isn't even a single superhero moment, even horrible films like catwoman or Morbius has superhero moments & action, this thing doesn't, you get instead visions of the future to potentially set up sequels.This movie also has a serious problem of product placement, it's a long commercial, to be exact a long Pepsi commercial, I feel like Pepsi stopped the halftime show so they could invest in the product placement in this film. This movie was more important to them than the superbowl LOL it's just so over the top & obviously placed way too much in this film. Calvin Klein, Chase bank, the list goes on. This movie should be called superhero product placement the movie.It's barely even close to a 1/10 the cool moments are seeing what we already saw in the trailer when she's seeing the future & you think it's happening now but then it goes back to the moment she realizes it's a vision, granted it's cool the first couple times but it gets old REAL quick. & it ends up getting annoying because it's abused way too much.Thats about it, there isn't any redeeming things in this film, the acting isn't even good. I would say the 3 side character spider women that Dakota finds when they are together there was a potential spark. I saw the talent & potential, but they are failed big time by such a horrid script that the spark never even sparks, it's just like showing you the matches & gasoline & not setting the fire.Madame M0RBIUS / 10.","1","16 February 2024"
"olcare","It's the worst movie and superhero adaptation I've watched in recent years. Completely atrocious effects, atrocious screenplay, and atrocious acting. Also, a big insult to all comic book readers and those who know the original story.Let me describe the movie simply. First of all, I am filled with hatred; I really want to curse the entire creative team for this unacceptable film.All the performances are bad, everyone. There's not a single good actor trying; everyone just took the role for money. It's a terrible disgrace, a total eclipse of reason.The screenplay is the worst superhero screenplay I've ever seen. It barely resembles the original story, and if there aren't scenes like the other Spider-Girls in the trailer, why include them? There's no such obligation; instead, write a decent screenplay. All action scenes are full of logical errors; they've written it without thinking, it's complete garbage.Apart from these, the direction, sorry to say, is garbage too. Most scenes are shot as if they were taken straight from a phone camera; action scenes are not shown, they're hidden due to the atrociousness of the effects. It's shameful.After these general points, Sony urgently needs to cancel this universe; the original stories are garbage, there's no logic, no connection anywhere. They're just being shot randomly. I don't like to curse, but I hope this film sinks at the box office.The last scene with Madame Web gaining her powers, those web effects, clinging to souls, it's unbelievable how you approved this film, may God punish you.I don't know which one to talk about; all the atrocities are collected in this film. Whether it's the woman going to Peru and back in 30 seconds, Spider-Man dodging with fireworks, dancing at the boys' table when my daughters are left alone, not telling the story of the Spider-Human community, or the woman talking normally while giving birth at the end, everything is a disgrace. I hope this universe sinks, and you all get fired. No one involved in the management of this film deserves their job respectfully; they should quit immediately.Note: Dakota Johnson made a statement saying she didn't watch the movie. Why are you serving a completely garbage film if you're not going to watch it? Life shouldn't be all about money for you; we, in our poverty, are trying to watch it, and this is no different from cursing all the audience's families. Shame on you.Note 2: Just now, I looked at the budget of the movie, and my anger grew even more, 80 million dollars EIGHTY MILLION. How can I not believe this money, I really can't believe it, it's nothing but disrespect to yourself, disrespect to the audience, nothing but an insult.","1","16 February 2024"
"sinscopefilms","First Impression:The opening of the Madame Web was immersed in a mystique and ambition, enhanced by great musical score; yet, as the movie progresses, it becomes a mixed bag and a rollercoaster of emotions.The Positive:Musical Score and Sound Design: The standout feature of ""Madame Web"" is its musical score. The soundtrack not only enhances the emotional depth of the film but also succeeds in creating in some moments genuine goosebumps. The sound design really enhances this impact by carefully using sound pans, bass, and reverse effects. It creates a sense of tension and immersion which is one of the film's strongest features.The Mixed:Visual Effects and Costume Design: Some of the visual effects in ""Madame Web"" were visually appealing. The costume design, like Casey's red jacket and the three spider girl villain outfits standing out as particularly stunning contributions to the film's aesthetic, but it was not often shown in the film since the films direction and focus was different. I was disappointed.Acting and Direction: Although I thought Casey's character development - her ability to see the world from a different perspective - was great, I didn't like how it was visually presented. The way it was edited was poorly done. The editor could use 2 distinct color grading features where one sees the future and two, she sees the present moment.However, The performances throughout the film feel lackluster, with the actors appearing confused and disengaged. This, combined with direction that fails to maintain interest or coherence in many scenes, significantly undermines the film's potential.Negatives:Cinematography: Cinematography is bad since some pictures don't show a clear image. The camera moves so fast that I cannot comprehend the picture. I kind of recognized that it tries to initiate the rapidness of the events from the spider's eye point of view but it was a tasteless decision. The Cinematography is not something like wow. The reason why Cinematography was lacking is because it was heavily based on medium closeups and dutch tilts which on one hand was a unique choice but on the other hand very hard to watch. I found the 180 degree round camera rotations super cool, but again, I expected varied distance shots, not just medium shots. The train scene Cinematography was the best in the film.Editing and Pace: The editing is arguably the weakest element of ""Madame Web,"" with its rapid cuts and disjointed flow detracting significantly from the storytelling. This lack of coherence makes it challenging for the audience to fully engage with the narrative.Plot and Overall Execution: The storyline of ""Madame Web"" is cluttered and clichéd, suffering from a lack of originality and clear direction. The film's ambition is evident, but the execution falls short of creating a compelling narrative.The Conclusion:""Madame Web"" presents a paradoxical experience, with exceptional music and sound design standing that sharply contrasts with its various flaws in editing, cinematography, and direction.Although there are some visually and emotionally stunning moments, they are frequently overshadowed by a lack of coherence and clarity.Also, I think this film would be reasonable and great to be incorporated in a TV series which would have allowed for a more in-depth exploration of characters and plot.Nevertheless, Madame Web is a bit of a mixed bag, with moments of potential that ultimately leave the viewer something different visually.Rating: 3/10.","3","15 February 2024"
"Skruffbagg","Cannon, is that you in disguise?I firmly believe Madame Web will go down in history as not only the worst superhero movie, but also one of the worst movies ever made. It's that bad. It's absolutely fascinating to behold.Now, I'll be honest with you here. I only went to see this because I had heard it was an unmitigated disaster that had to be seen to be believed, and it truly does not disappoint - or massively does, depending on your viewpoint.It takes a special kind of director to get such cringe-inducing performances out of a fairly talented cast (Dakota Johnson and Tahar Rahim are both quality actors with the right script and direction), but SJ Clarkson somehow manages to wrangle the absolute worst imaginable from every single person in the film. I'll be very surprised if she ever does another feature after this.Nothing in this film works; the plot is moronic, the script seems like it was written by a teenager, the cinematography is horrendous, the aformentioned embarrassing performances, the audio editing is baffling (so much dubbing, brain-melting music choices). I'm amazed this didn't get shelved the minute the final cut was done.To me, I rate this as ""so bad it's good"" as I wasn't bored watching it, but most people I assume will say it's just plain bad... and it is, but very entertainingly so.If you love watching a 2hr car crash then I highly recommend this. The awfulness is mind-boggling in it's complexity, but in the best possible way. Film scholars and historians will be analysing this movie for years to come, and I hope it is talked about in the same vein as The Room in the future.An absolutely epic misfire on all levels.","1","20 February 2024"
"MiroslavKyuranov","It's astonishing to think that Sony could put out a worse product than 2022's Morbius, but boy, ""Madame Web"" manages it. It is an embarrassing mess. Talented stars wasted on probably one of the worst comic book movie ever (which nobody asked for). Filled with atrocious dialogue, awkward editing and laughable structure. It's a clunky, poorly-written, messy, and sloppy movie packed with some mediocre editing and performances.The concept is interesting on paper, but it couldn't be saved due to it's terrible execution. ""Madame Web"" simply lacked the spark it needed in nearly every dept.There is simply nothing memorable in this movie, except maybe some superhero costumes, but that doesn't redeem the fact that the movie is bad.So yeah...""Madame Web"" is yet another disappointing entry in the Sony's Spider-Less universe. It's like a love letter to an era of superhero films that people largely want to forget. The ""Pepsi"" adds are stand-out, it falls short of what could have been a decent movie in the hands of someone else twenty years ago.","4","14 February 2024"
"darrelltill","There is nothing good in this film. It's badly written - not just full of clichés but full of dialogue that is meant to sound like cliché superhero idioms yet butchered until they make no sense. It is nothing but a costume parade with players that are dead behind the eyes. You can tell that everybody involved knows it's going to be a stinker but they'd already signed on and it was too late. It would be great if this was the flop that made Disney rethink their output (I know, this is actually an SSU movie not an MCU movie, but they are all heading down the same path) but I fear it will take a few more. The solution is really simple - they need to adjust their hiring policy to include persons of talent.","1","15 February 2024"
"movieman6-413-929510","Madame Web is a new spin-off set in the Marvel Spider-Man world. This spin-off is directed, partly written and produced by S. J. Clarkson. Before this film, she directed more TV series episodes of superhero shows such as Jessica Jones and The Defenders.Cassandra Webb (Dakota Johnson) works as a paramedic in New York and learns after an accident that she has superpowers to see future possibilities. She sees that the lives of three girls are threatened by a mysterious masked man with spider-like powers.This is why she tries to protect the three girls and must convince them that their lives are really in danger. To truly protect them, they must ensure that the three listen to her and learn to work together.The story of this film has an interesting concept, but the final story and screenplay were written by five different writers. These writers do not always seem to have been on the same page, because the story sometimes seems a bit rushed or frayed. It sometimes seems as if they didn't really know what exactly to do with it, or what the film studio despised of them. The screenplay has also been rewritten many times, so the cast members could no longer always follow exactly where they were going or supposed to do with the film.Despite these messy, rushed aspects, the film remains on a familiar, predictable side for a superhero film. This can make the film seem a bit long-winded or embarrassing. The film is reminiscent of other superhero films that came out around the year 2000, but of a somewhat lesser quality.The visual effects don't always look believable either. The blue screen and CGI can be seen in the film. For some of the cast members, this was also the first time they had actually worked in a film with such visual effects. The fact that they have little or no experience with these film situations is sometimes reflected in their acting.The poor script also gives the cast members few opportunities to make something special of their roles. Dakota Johnson also seemed a bit uncomfortable during promotions of the film, or ignorant of how to properly promote this film. In the final film she tries to make the best of the role and tries to add some comedy to the role, but she doesn't always get the chance to do this. Sydney Sweeney, Isabela Merced and Celeste O'Connor play the three girls Cassandra tries to protect. All three are given a little time to give their characters some personalities, but unfortunately not enough to make you as a viewer really care about the three. For a better focused film, they might have been better off using a character in the story, who Cassandra then has to protect. Tahar Rahim plays the villain in the film, who tries to kill the three girls, but also deals with the poor, weak script. As a result, he does not emerge as strongly as the villain of the story. They also didn't incorporate his audio work well into the film, because his lips sometimes don't always match what his character is saying.With all these superhero spin-off films from the Sony film studio, they only make Marvel's current film series more messy. If Sony and Disney Marvel try to collaborate on the same film series, they will have to consult each other more and better and plan where they want to go with this film series.","2","17 February 2024"
"ethanbresnett","Based on Madame Web's woeful reviews I was expecting this film to be an utter car crash. To its credit I will say it isn't entirely without merit, but it is incredibly boring and bland.Mostly this is because nothing particularly happens. It's a superhero movie with little to no superhero action and a painfully long set up for an underwhelming final act. The characters are so underdeveloped that there is no emotional connection or investment in any of them. Everything about the story and writing just feels lazy, vacuous and corny.Then there's the villain who is utterly uninspiring. He is constantly complaining about 'everything he has built' being destroyed. What has he built you might ask? The film has no interest in exploring this question. He's easily one of the more two dimensional and weak superhero villains I've ever seen committed to screen.Perhaps the most heinous crime this movie commits is to waste the talents of Dakota Johnson, Sydney Sweeney, Adam Scott, Emma Roberts, Zosia Mamet and more. Such a good cast was assembled and they were given absolutely nothing to work with, so I don't blame the performers. It's just such a shame to see such great talent put to the sword like this.As if all of this wasn't enough, the movie also feels remarkably low budget and feels excruciatingly long despite its relatively short runtime.Ultimately I think this film suffered because it was clearly intended as a set up for a wider Spider-Woman franchise which is unlikely to come to fruition. There seemed to be no interest in making a good stand alone movie, and no respect for the audience. A massive waste of time.","3","21 February 2024"
"vfphvnpp","I understand what the plan was here. They wanted a trippy film, focusing on a strong future for the Sony verse. The problem is the delivery. The camera work in this movie made it quite irritating to follow, as there was constant quick close up shots of the action. The dialogue was awful, and there was quite a lot of blatant voice over during the villain scenes.So much wasted time was given to boring scenes in the movie, which led me to believe the screen writers finished the script and realised that it was under the word count.Honestly the acting quality was quite poor across the board, especially the villain, who honestly seems as if they didn't cast for his role at all, just picked up someone off the side of the road.For someone who's guilty pleasure is watching bad movies, I it was a painful time. Don't recommend.","2","14 February 2024"
"jtorch-11283","Don't waste your time, and money seeing this in theaters. I was fooled by the trailer which looked promising. All the action in the whole film ( a total of 2 scenes) is shown in the the trailer. The rest of the movie is just terrible acting trying to save an even worse scrip.I'm honestly not sure how this made it to the big screen. I'm not a cinema expert, but shouldn't someone have to view the finished product and give the O. K. At some point before it is ""audience ready?"" I feel like that step in the process was skipped. I don't know what Marvel had to do with this film, but it certainly isn't the Iron-Man-Marvel I keep hoping they will somehow revive.And to whom it may concern, ""my parents don't love me."" Is neither a solid backstory OR a strong character trait. I hope you eat a lot of money on this movie.","1","15 February 2024"
"cosby_don","I don't know where to start-actually, I do! THIS IS THE WORST MOVIE IN THE HISTORY OF HUMANITY. I'm not kidding.I'm not sure what other movie this Dakota Johnson has been in, but after watching THIS movie, I'll probably never support her again. This was an absolute career killer. Ms. Johnson, please FIRE your agent immediately.To the production crew, editors, director, and ESPECIALLY the writers (I counted 4 writers-that's RIDICULOUS), shame on you for contributing to this mess. It's obvious you've traded in your morals for a paycheck. That's Hollywood for ya'.Did I mention that this movie was HORRENDOUSLY bad? Everything about this movie was bad-there are ZERO redeeming qualities.The story: STUPID. Worst I've ever seen, seriously. Madam Web ask the girls to wait for 3 hours in the woods? STUPID. The guy partner keeping the girls as Madam Web flies to Peru to check something out. STUPID. Madam a Web getting her powers from a spider bite through her mother. STUPID. I could seriously go on and on. I'm not kidding-EVERYTHING in this movie was STUPID. I can't count how many times I shook my head and said ""This is so bad.""The acting? Very wooden. Ms. Dakota Johnson's acting chops were the worst of the worst here. I really pray that she's done work much better. The other girls-they tried. Jokes fell flat, and they said the DUMBEST lines ever in a movie. I was seriously angry at how dumb they were.The villain? The most generic, uninteresting, uncool villain over ever seen on film. Not one memorable quote. Come to think, did he even make a ""evil guy"" speech? Nope!The ending? Oh my, HORRENDOUS. She's smiling in her glasses while paralyzed in a wheel chair? MAN WHI WROTE THIS MESS??The girls weren't even in costume more than 2 minutes of the entire film, even though in the trailer we came to expect them to be crime fighters and kicking butt in the film.

"rgkarim","LIKES:The Commentary At Times
-Some lines in this movie are startling at how funny they were for me, a fantastic bout of teenage emotions with a less than thrilled babysitter.-Madame Web's origin story is almost like an anti-hero tale to Charles Xavier idea, and though it's not fully fleshed out, there is emotion, fun, and what felt natural angst and vulnerability into it.-With the right timing, and build up, this section of commentary was a striking positive in this reviewers book.Representation of Paramedics
-It's a rare thing to get to actually see E. M. T's in their work and what they give to serve the public.-While a bit forced, and perhaps a tad overdone and cheesy, kudos for Madame Web accomplishing some detailed shots of them serving the public and giving a little character development with it.-There were great avenues taken to help ingrain parts into the story, and with that, the medical nerd inside me found a cool little nod in those sequences.Some Artistic Visuals Are Cool
-I'm a sucker for a good shot and a good artistic visual popping out and ingraining itself into my mind.-Madame Web has some of these moments for me, the creepy and yet serene world of the Web World, being one that holds majesty and mystery, but also the very emotions of the person trying to wield it.-Other shots of costume crusaders striking that right pose, or perhaps that nostalgic early 2000s look, really help establish some of the themes of the movie or a good set up visual to cascade into.-It may be sprinkled about, but there were some superhero visuals that accomplished the job for me in Madame Web.Talented Cast
-Celeste O'Connor is very fun in this movie. A tad quirky, but she keeps the attitude going, a lot of that sass very fun and usually well-placed to help move the story towards forced comedy and obvious story telling.-Merced eventually grew on me after she got into the meat of her character and starting to push past the stubborn and cheeky attitude. She's got charming charisma, a fun brainy side to exploit, and this sadness that she uses to illicit such emotion, something I wanted more of, but got only little.-Sweeney is fun in this movie. Toned down from the other roles I've seen, the woman knows how to adapt her style and give me something to hook to several times. I love the awkwardness she brings, the tie in to the two extremes, and her surprising smallness after she plays such big roles.-And Johnson is about the same as she always is. A snarky and condescending nature that she wields expertly, but a tad dry at times that some lines feel unfulfilled. Fortunately, she's got good chemistry with the girls that assisted in smoothing out the faults.Some Surprising Character Arcs
-The movie may miss a lot of things, but there are a few moments that work very well to show the potential of Madame Web if given the right focus.-An opening that holds some merit was one of the victories, something that would eventually bleed into plot points further on that gave you a very touching moment.-And another element has the other's origin stories granting us some potential hurt and relatable tales to latch onto and acknowledge. Again, helping give a young and in your face Charlie's Angel group some vim and vigor.The Music
-Call me a sucker for nostalgia, Madame Web has a mix of songs that were perfect for viewers like me to enjoy.-Comedic use of the songs are not the most creative, but add that minor element to help give the girls a little more dynamic and believability.-While other times, it's just a blast of the speakers and me dancing in my seat as the forgotten wonder returns for another run to get things started.DISLIKES:The Pacing Uneven
-Despite the trinkets and some merits to the story, Madame Web's dislikes for me start with the pacing of the tale.-A moderately slow start did little to keep me engaged, only to then have these sprints of faster moments to try to change things up, before hitting the brakes again.-Like a CW season crammed into one, Madame Web's pacing feels a lot like dressed up teenage drama trying to give realism and gradual steps, but really just being the mashup of the uglier time use dramas can get stuck to.The Stale Mechanic
-From the trailers, you know there is some type of vision gimmick that Cassie is supposed to use to protect her charges.-That gimmick gets stale very quickly for a viewer like me, the convoluted presentation starting out fun at first, but then turning into annoying déjà vu that felt more like reshoots than actual artistic twisting.-Like Moon Knight, that element makes sense at first, but really could have stopped halfway through the movie once the viewers has connected the powers.-Had there been a bit more excitement, fighting, or even better storytelling to distract, it would have been less impactful, but alas, for me, all the other limitations added up.Lack of Other Character Development
-There are a lot of characters in this movie, some played by bigger names than the leads themselves. And yet, their time and character development felt shoehorned than planned out.-Adam Scott and Emma Roberts seem disengaged, with stories that are cliché, simplistic, and a waste of talent that again showed potential with that slower pacing at the start.-But even the villain and main girls tales feel very bland, and that lack of character development was very much felt by me that it almost seems to rely heavily on another movie to do these characters justice.Annoying Dialogue
-I know, I said the commentary was good, but that was a small amount of it compared to the whole.-Madame Web's dialogue seems to have gone through the writing grinder several times, very loaded with one liners, sassy comments and attitude that seemed to be out of place for much of the film for me.-Statements of the obvious, corny dialogue essentially pushed in with too simplistic of writing and in your face, overdramatic flair to count as quality dialogue. It needs tuning up, needs to be less forceful, and try to add a little Hollywood magic to help tenderize it to something matching a comic book movie.A Villain Needing A Lot More
-Don't get me wrong, there is an element to him that is relatable, believable, and indeed threatening in terms of the madness of his actions.-But outside of this and the opening scene, Ezekiel is a very bland bad guy who just didn't get the time to shine outside of crawling and repeating the same lines over and over.-The direction failed to give him any recognizable skills, his threats empty most of the time and sort of creepy obsessive, and dare I say his actual character is zoomed over and practically absent but for the opening line.-To me, that's a limited villain and one major flaw that much of the movie suffers from.Visuals Get Really Muddy/Bad
-Sony makes such great looking video games, and yet their movies still suffer from last gen effects
-While the artistic flair of those moments was enjoyable, they did have that faux effect that dropped some of the realism this movie was going for.-Even worse, there are lots of movements, character renderings, and powers that leave a lot to be desired in looking their best. I won't say it's a dealbreaker, but it doesn't help to have such limited technology presentation.Scenes/Story Seem Very Chopped Up
-Between the gimmicks and pacing, the scenes already feel limited, messy, and almost like an abbreviated version of what they could be.-Sure, the dialogue gives you everything they are going for, but the presentation felt very much like a lot of reshoots of the same scene, and slight changes that made little difference.-Such indecisive direction and edits got away from them and left me just wondering what this film could have been with half the gimmicks of the visions pulled back.The Action Is Very Boring
-No denying this, Madame Web maybe even worse than many of the CW attempts at action.-While witty, and an amusing game of cat and mouse, a Spiderverse without a solid one or two fights is a verse I'm not fond playing in for nearly two hours.-A lame villain does little but strut and crawl, while our cast somehow running away and eluding comes off a bit pathetic than entertaining.-Even the climax is a mess, rushed finishes, suspense of disbelief, and an overdramatic battle of words with a very extravagant and mushy ending to cap it off.-Eternals at least had a few moves that had me rocking in my seat, but this... this was a challenge to stay awake in.The VERDICT:
Madame Web is certainly not the worst movie I've seen in years, but that doesn't mean Sony's latest is a masterpiece either. There are elements of this vision that show the potential for a good future, but need a lot of work to make up for this rushed installment. A talented cast, music and some fun writing can be the starting building blocks, but it can't offset what feels like lots of production limitations, rewrites, and editing that greatly show in this movie. Boring battles, annoying gimmicks, and under developed characters despite a strong cast were just some of the limitations this movie has to work through if a series is to come with it. Should one see it in theaters? Not really. A shot at home, I would say sure, but with all of this, my scores for the movie are:Action/Adventure/Sci-Fi: 6.0
Movie Overall: 5.0.","5","15 February 2024"
"eddie_baggins","I'm not ashamed to admit I've seen some movies in my time.I am however ashamed to admit curiosity got the better of me and I ended up in an almost entirely empty cinema screening (thanks to one tolerant movie buddy who joined me on my trip to the local cinema) partaking in what can only be described as one of the most universally panned Hollywood blockbusters of the modern era.Not at all interested in watching another Sony Marvel outing after their last few efforts, hearing about the insanely awesome awfulness of Madame Web from friends, internet identities and esteemed critics made me want to witness a potential all-time cringe-fest and while when people are absolutely right in their hyperbole around just how bad Madame Web is, I'm still trying to comprehend how I could possibly testify to just how bad things are here.Directed by long time TV episode director S. J. Clarkson and featuring a cast of performers who have all proven over time to be more than capable of bringing the goods, Madame Web is not devoid of talent that may have been able to salvage some type of goodness from an offence against the entire cinematic medium but as a finished? (Honestly I am unsure how anyone could claim this is an acceptable final version, just watch for some of the most flawed examples of ADR you're ever going to see) product there was no one or any thing that could've saved this nightmare from the fate it had created for itself.An experience that could only possibly come from a collective group who all gave up the fight to save it long before shooting had wrapped, Madame Web inexcusably comes from the same penmanship that was guilty of unleashing Morbius on us but screenwriters Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless at least managed to find some cult like goodness in Jared Leto and Matt Smith's wildly OTT characters and bizarre action segments but Madame Web is nothing more than two hours of terrible plot, characters, spectacle and intentions and there is quite literally no valid reason for this movie to exist in the form it has been given.One of the most atrociously acted Hollywood films ever captured, with lead Dakota Johnson unable to hold back her disdain for a film she clearly hated being a part of and poor old Tahar Rahim taking the films most unfortunate mantle from a wigged Sydney Sweeney, Madame Web may have been promoted as some type of intense action thriller following the exploits of Johnson's Cassandra Webb as she battles Rahim's Ezekiel Sims alongside Sweeney's Julia, Isabela Merced's Anya and Celeste O'Connor's Mattie but we get something else entirely that is hard to come to terms with.From some of the most detestable and frequent examples of product placement that becomes instantly iconic (some viewers may find themselves attempting to crack open a Pepsi can in their Calvin Klein's after a viewing), a villain we literally know nothing about with zero attempts to bother explaining his plans or background, an embarrassing use of comic staple characters that aren't even put into action outside of dream sequences and a script that must surely have been conjured on ChatGPT, Madame Web is a cesspool of Hollywood excrement that isn't even funny in its horribleness, just merely sad and depressing.The only justifiable reason for Madame Web to be the film it is as it stands is if Sony are deliberately attempting to sabotage their Marvel property that no longer is allowed to include many fan favourites, if they aren't in fact doing that there is zero excuses for why Madame Web has ever been allowed to be birthed into existence.An irredeemable, amateurish and embarrassing exercise in pointless, Madame Web is a shockingly bad example of blockbuster filmmaking that is the exact type of bottom feeder product the cinema industry and the Marvel brand didn't need at this particular point of time.Final Say -If you're a glutton for punishment and want to be reminded of everything you wouldn't wish to see in a supposed piece of big screen entertainment then Madame Web is for you! A truly iconic new addition to the staples of all-time misfires, nothing could prepare one for the garbage that is this $80 million dollar disasterpiece.0 fireworks to the head out of 5.Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)","1","22 February 2024"
"shaikhirshad-41223","Literally I had zero expectations when I went to watch this flick but I still thought that something should be good in this to watch at least one time because of marvel name in it.

Because the character they're playing is so bad and not even proper dialogues are given and just they have made a common character with no story arc just the situation that they have to act
I've never seen such a bad cinematography of any film it looks like they don't have any interest making this film so they just made a spoof just to show that we are making a movie.

"vengeance20","Ok, so before people come at me with the ""YoU dIdN't LiKe It BeCaUsE iT wAs FeMaLe LeAd."" chestnut. I went into this one with an open mind, but expecting it to be as described & the reviews were right. The film is bad.The film sees Cassandra Webb who is a New York metropolis paramedic who begins to demonstrate signs of clairvoyance. Forced to challenge revelations about her past, she needs to safeguard 3 young girls from a deadly adversary who wants them destroyed.I found the film to be pretty bad. It's disjointed, clunky, poorly paced & just feels very awkward & stiff. The characters are personality-less, they look & sound as if they're reciting their lines from cue cards (almost robotic, I might add) & the script reads like a supermarket shopping receipt.The films story is all over the place, confusing & hard to follow. The premonition sequences the main lead experiences were annoying & while creative, were repetitive to the point where you couldn't tell if she was hallucinating or actually seeing what she was seeing.The films runtime is overly long for what it is, while not as bad as other films which are generally over 2 hours (rolls eyes), this film felt longer & as I said was too long for what it was at 1 hour & 48 minutes (108 minutes) without credits & the pacing, jeez... don't get me started.The actors were alright, but what they were given script wise, didn't work & made them come across as flat. There's some action & not bad effects to be had, but that's pretty much the only redeeming features from this flick, sadly. It hasn't a lot going for it & is pretty lack luster & basic.Don't get me wrong, I prefer films with straight forward story-lines & plots you can follow, but this one was a bit too basic & could've used more meatiness to beef it up more as well as more emphasis to keep the audience engaged with the story, characters, action etc.I generally didn't like the film & the ending is just out there too & is pretty cringy like some of the scenes in the film as well as the few cringy action sequences themselves among some of the good action we got.Overall, it's a bad film. And no, it's got nothing to do with the old chestnut of me being a man who doesn't like the film because it's female lead. The film was bad & had plenty of things wrong with it. People in general, men & women, boys & girls, didn't like this flick.The story is bland, boring & paper thin like the characters & leads, the little bit of good action & effects seen are overshadowed by the aforementioned issues as well as the other issues like the poor runtime, pacing & the lacking engagement the film has.Also, for those who can't seem to get it in their heads, there's been plenty of female lead films in the past that have done well, from the Alien Franchise to The Hunger Games along with Elektra, Tomb Raider, Salt, Lucy, Hanna etc. I could go on but that's my rant for those who need calling out.2/10.","2","20 February 2024"

"alindsayal","With Marvel Studios taking on more responsibility involving Spider-Man, Sony have decided to try and build a universe involving smaller characters from the same lore as him. We have had Venom and Morbius and will get Kraven The Hunter later this year but here we have Madame Web. I saw this film last night and here is my review for Madame Web. The p[remise of the film sees a women bestowed with powers where she has to save 3 girls from being killed by a villainous foe.Main Character
I must be honest that I have never been a huge fan of Dakota Johnson and she plays Cassandra Web here and I have to be honest she isn't particularly good here. She is overacting everything here and her character is super unlikeable and hard to care about. She is clearly hampered by the awful writing in this film and she can't rise above it and give us a lead role to support or care about and Cassie Web will go down as one of the worst leads in a comic book film ever.Supporting Characters
Sydney Sweeney, Isabela Merced & Celeste O'Connor play the three girls that are in the view of the villain and they are all pretty awful. Their characters are really awkward and not particularly likeable, the film tries to force you to like and care about these characters but it comes across poorly and these actresses aren't good enough to make me care.Tahar Rahim plays Ezekiel Sims and he is one of the more frustrating parts of this film because I have seen him be a good actor and this character had some potential but the film really flops here and makes him this over the top villain that is so stupid that it really takes you out of the film.Adam Scott as Ben Parker is probably the best person here but he isn't really given much to do and it still upsets me that he plays Ben Parker and it is really clear that this was just done to provide some stupid fan service that actually annoys me even more.Story
The story is nonsensical and completely stupid. The plot makes no sense and characters do things that make no sense, Cassie Web in particular is one of the dumbest characters that I have seen in recent movies. This film also tries its best to ruin the character of Spider-Man even though he isn't in the film and it is just the backdrop to this pretty dull and horrendous adventure.Script
This is a really awfully written film. Things make no sense, characters are unlikeable and there is no humour here at all. There are so many plot holes it is crazy and the film has nothing interesting about it at all.Style
I mean I guess the action scenes are okay and the bad guys suit was okay but that is it. The film is filmed really poorly, the editing looks unfinished and at times it is actually quite jarring to watch it. There are way too many jump scares especially for a film that is not a horror film. The trailer shows things that barely happen in the film and it feels like we were sold a different film that never got made.Overall
Overall, Madame Web is a truly disastrous film. This is up there with one of the worst films I have ever seen and is up there with the worst comic book films of all time. Though I am glad I saw this film to have this experience but at all cost avoid this garbage and do something better for 2 hours.Rating - 1/10.","1","16 February 2024"
"daisukereds","A baby-sitting movie in a Superhero setting, where the lead can see the future and has to prevent NOT-Spiderman from killing teenagers (because he has dreams/visions about them). The girls run and hide around a lot, some BS happens and then the movie ends.The foundation of the script is heavily written around a hollow core of ""parents and children"". The cinematography is actually good, and at least ""teaches"" how to do CPR. It also does away with showing premonitions every time something is to be changed near the end.. respecting the viewers intelligence in at least that aspect! And it's easy to follow (if you don't fall asleep) with how simplistic it is.Aside from that, it is barely anything else..
The movie itself isn't terrible.. it's just beyond bland and boring. Also, calling this a Superhero movie is really disingenuous and a marketing ploy to get people to see it. Stay home! There are no good action sequences and nobody is written memorably....
Venom making money was a mistake. Sony has half a franchise, and they can't get anyone talented enough to do something with it. And what they continue to release seems like high-budgeted fan fiction!","3","16 February 2024"
"isaacsundaralingam","Yea, this was garbage and that's saying plenty. It's actually adorable how little anyone cared about ""Madame Web"" - not just the audience, but the filmmakers and actors themselves. Written by the same people who wrote ""Morbius"", this movie is yet another reason to not let them anywhere near a writing software ever again.Not only was the movie unwatchable due to how lifeless it was, but it was also criminally boring. You're waiting for something to happen and you keep waiting right until the credits start to roll. Nothing about the movie was compelling, the plot was riddled with plot holes, the screenplay was lazy, the dialogues were dead and the acting was almost as if the actors were held captive and being forced to act as if everything was okay. It reeks of corporate greed and there isn't a single positive thing to say about this movie.We're only a month and half into the year and we already have a very strong contender for what might be the worst movie of the year, and it's not even close. Don't watch it, but if you do indeed decide to, I hope you lived a life well enough to have a crowded funeral.","1","19 February 2024"
"syntory","Look at the profiles for the writers that wrote Madame Web. You'll see virtually every movie they've written has a bad rating and bad reviews. Why then does Hollywood continually hire these same writers for these big budget films? I could understand if they wrote movies for Asylum Films because all their movies are terrible.Madame Web is god awful! Very difficult to sit through. None of the main characters are likeable. Even the villain is lame. It seems like the entire movie was written to set up a sequel. But why would people spend money to see the sequel of a movie that is one of the worst movies ever written? I'm shocked at how bad this movie is and if there is a sequel I certainly wont bother watching it.Stop hiring bad writers, Hollywood!","2","15 February 2024"
"MovieWarfare","I would absolutely love to be in these Sony meetings because I am absolutely baffled how things like Madame Web are getting greenlit.Madame Web is one of the worst superhero movies ever made! It has terrible writing, characters, action setpieces and even acting. Dakota Johnson is so dull and boring as the main lead but this is probably down to the terrible script.To be fair, the movie does have an interesting concept with this Final Destination x Terminator thing. However, it is so poorly executed that it makes Morbius look like The Dark Knight.Anyway give me the ""He Was in the Amazon With My Mom When She Was Researching Spiders Right Before She Died"" cut!","1","17 February 2024"
"chenp-54708","Literally one of the worst superhero movies I have ever seen.From the advertisements, I knew this movie wasn't going to be great but still, it surprised me how bad and boring it was. Everything about the direction, writing, characters, technical aspects, and designs are really awful. The writing is poor as there are many concepts, ideas and aspects that are messy and bland. The messy script creates poor dialogue from the cast and the characters are not interesting. The special effects looked even worse than the marketing and all of the performances were pretty bad. I honestly do feel bad for Dakota Johnson cause she is a good actress but she deserves to have better roles then this. It can be said for the same for the rest of the cast members.The uses of product placements are annoying, action moments are dull, and and all in all, it was boring. Superhero movies shouldn't be boring but this really dragged on. It's unfortunate cause female superhero leads are something I love to see more like Wonder Woman and The Old Guard which are pretty fun. But unfortunately, it seemed that it likely isn't going to happen anytime soon.There really isn't anything else to say.Bad.","1","14 February 2024"
"AlsExGal","... when I saw Dakota Johnson was starring in it. Naturally I can't lay the entirety of this hot mess at her feet. But there is some really bad campy acting happening on her part, reminiscent of the Fifty Shades of Grey movies in which she starred. Perhaps it was because the director was more interested in the placement of Pepsi cans than her performance, but I digress.Basically, this movie plays out like the cut scenes from a budget Xbox 360 game. From the ground up this thing just feels designed to fail. It feels almost Producersesque in its approach in just how every aspect is seemingly intentionally mangled, yet no one seems to care. How have we come so full circle to go through the glory of Infinity War/Logan/The Dark Knight to arrive all the way back to Batman and Robin and Catwoman levels of superhero flicks? (Bam!, Pow!, Gosh yes Batman!)How did this movie make it so far that it has an actual release, and no one stopped it? How did this idea get green lit? Why did Sony give 80 million and turn over their valuable IP to the people that wrote Morbius, Gods of Egypt, Dracula Untold and The Last Witch Hunter? How did this get past the writing process and again have that script greenlit? How could no one on the set at any point stop things? How did no one in the editing room point out how bad it looked and how much of a mess it was?But to the suits it's not about art and story. Instead it's about business, and people are just a commodity. It's cheaper to recycle known quantities, and practice nepotism and involve maybe less than talented friends, people you've worked with before, than go out and find artists with worthy stories. They don't care about art, they don't care about stories, they care about making this work for them financially, regardless of loss of reputation with audiences as a whole.Youtuber Chris Stuckmann did a deep dive on the topic of big studios being generally run by folks who came up through management rather than the creative rungs such as writing and directing when he discussed this film. His take is worth watching. For some reason, Chris doesn't do critical movie reviews since he has become a filmmaker, but I can tell by his tone that, like me, he was completely displeased watching this one. I'd avoid it.","2","17 February 2024"
"eoinageary","This is, well I guess this is a movie in the Sony universe that I'm SHOCKED is profitable.The story is all over the place, it's basically about Madame Web who is a paramedic and develops powers and can see into the future, with a current threat she tries to change the future, teaming up with 3 powerful characters who are yet to develop into their full potential so she must shield them and change the future to protect them.Trying not to give the little story that gets told away in the opening there but i have to be vague.What I liked, one or two good scenes, I didn't mind the end, I really liked a lot of the camera work some cool looking shots and a decent Score.But the movie is BAD, it makes Morbius look like The Batman 2022. The acting is lacking, the actors look as bored as you will feel. Script is bad, just some beyond silly lines, the story chops and changes so much your neck will hurt you, some bad CGI, and just boring action.And before people harp on about ""you don't like it because it's women leads"" no, it's just a crap film, I enjoyed the marvels, Black Widow was decent, so no, the movie regardless of its leads is just poor.Extremely disappointing, 3/10.","3","14 February 2024"
"tbunker-88294","I can honestly say that once again (not that anyone is surprised) that Sony has bombed again with its superhero content. Underwhelming action, bad characters, weird dialogue, generic villain. Its just plain badI feel bad for the cast of this movie, you have EXCELLENT talent and its just wasted in this cash grab excuse of a movieSony has proved once again it can't be trusted with superhero content and has lost what little credibility it had. If the company had any integrity or wits left they should sell their share of ownership back to Marvel and let them assume FULL creative control.I'm not optimistic for Kraven The Hunter after seeing this gross disappointment.","1","14 February 2024"
"hotrobinproductions","Horrible from beginning to end, the opening scene just reeks of awful predictability from story & plot to the core. You know exactly what will happen before it even happens, the script sucks & the dialogue is even worse. There is quite noticeable audio dub edited after the fact too. This budget is 80 million, not that budget matters, because no amount of money could have saved this train wreck, but I mention this because you can still make a good film on lower budgets, Shazam, the first one, had the same budget & delt with a lot of side characters too, it's miles better, Godzilla minus one had a extremely low budget too. But this 80 million dollar film not just effects but production, feels obviously cheap, it almost feels like watching a very long pilot episode to a CW tv show.You thought Morbius was bad, that film was bad because it did the bare minimum, this film doesn't even do the bare minimum, it goes beyond comprehension below that, it just enters a point of no originality or ambition towards creating anything. There isn't even a single superhero moment, even horrible films like catwoman or Morbius has superhero moments & action, this thing doesn't, you get instead visions of the future to potentially set up sequels.This movie also has a serious problem of product placement, it's a long commercial, to be exact a long Pepsi commercial, I feel like Pepsi stopped the halftime show so they could invest in the product placement in this film. This movie was more important to them than the superbowl LOL it's just so over the top & obviously placed way too much in this film. Calvin Klein, Chase bank, the list goes on. This movie should be called superhero product placement the movie.It's barely even close to a 1/10 the cool moments are seeing what we already saw in the trailer when she's seeing the future & you think it's happening now but then it goes back to the moment she realizes it's a vision, granted it's cool the first couple times but it gets old REAL quick. & it ends up getting annoying because it's abused way too much.Thats about it, there isn't any redeeming things in this film, the acting isn't even good. I would say the 3 side character spider women that Dakota finds when they are together there was a potential spark. I saw the talent & potential, but they are failed big time by such a horrid script that the spark never even sparks, it's just like showing you the matches & gasoline & not setting the fire.Madame M0RBIUS / 10.","1","16 February 2024"
"olcare","It's the worst movie and superhero adaptation I've watched in recent years. Completely atrocious effects, atrocious screenplay, and atrocious acting. Also, a big insult to all comic book readers and those who know the original story.Let me describe the movie simply. First of all, I am filled with hatred; I really want to curse the entire creative team for this unacceptable film.All the performances are bad, everyone. There's not a single good actor trying; everyone just took the role for money. It's a terrible disgrace, a total eclipse of reason.The screenplay is the worst superhero screenplay I've ever seen. It barely resembles the original story, and if there aren't scenes like the other Spider-Girls in the trailer, why include them? There's no such obligation; instead, write a decent screenplay. All action scenes are full of logical errors; they've written it without thinking, it's complete garbage.Apart from these, the direction, sorry to say, is garbage too. Most scenes are shot as if they were taken straight from a phone camera; action scenes are not shown, they're hidden due to the atrociousness of the effects. It's shameful.After these general points, Sony urgently needs to cancel this universe; the original stories are garbage, there's no logic, no connection anywhere. They're just being shot randomly. I don't like to curse, but I hope this film sinks at the box office.The last scene with Madame Web gaining her powers, those web effects, clinging to souls, it's unbelievable how you approved this film, may God punish you.I don't know which one to talk about; all the atrocities are collected in this film. Whether it's the woman going to Peru and back in 30 seconds, Spider-Man dodging with fireworks, dancing at the boys' table when my daughters are left alone, not telling the story of the Spider-Human community, or the woman talking normally while giving birth at the end, everything is a disgrace. I hope this universe sinks, and you all get fired. No one involved in the management of this film deserves their job respectfully; they should quit immediately.Note: Dakota Johnson made a statement saying she didn't watch the movie. Why are you serving a completely garbage film if you're not going to watch it? Life shouldn't be all about money for you; we, in our poverty, are trying to watch it, and this is no different from cursing all the audience's families. Shame on you.Note 2: Just now, I looked at the budget of the movie, and my anger grew even more, 80 million dollars EIGHTY MILLION. How can I not believe this money, I really can't believe it, it's nothing but disrespect to yourself, disrespect to the audience, nothing but an insult.","1","16 February 2024"
"sinscopefilms","First Impression:The opening of the Madame Web was immersed in a mystique and ambition, enhanced by great musical score; yet, as the movie progresses, it becomes a mixed bag and a rollercoaster of emotions.The Positive:Musical Score and Sound Design: The standout feature of ""Madame Web"" is its musical score. The soundtrack not only enhances the emotional depth of the film but also succeeds in creating in some moments genuine goosebumps. The sound design really enhances this impact by carefully using sound pans, bass, and reverse effects. It creates a sense of tension and immersion which is one of the film's strongest features.The Mixed:Visual Effects and Costume Design: Some of the visual effects in ""Madame Web"" were visually appealing. The costume design, like Casey's red jacket and the three spider girl villain outfits standing out as particularly stunning contributions to the film's aesthetic, but it was not often shown in the film since the films direction and focus was different. I was disappointed.Acting and Direction: Although I thought Casey's character development - her ability to see the world from a different perspective - was great, I didn't like how it was visually presented. The way it was edited was poorly done. The editor could use 2 distinct color grading features where one sees the future and two, she sees the present moment.However, The performances throughout the film feel lackluster, with the actors appearing confused and disengaged. This, combined with direction that fails to maintain interest or coherence in many scenes, significantly undermines the film's potential.Negatives:Cinematography: Cinematography is bad since some pictures don't show a clear image. The camera moves so fast that I cannot comprehend the picture. I kind of recognized that it tries to initiate the rapidness of the events from the spider's eye point of view but it was a tasteless decision. The Cinematography is not something like wow. The reason why Cinematography was lacking is because it was heavily based on medium closeups and dutch tilts which on one hand was a unique choice but on the other hand very hard to watch. I found the 180 degree round camera rotations super cool, but again, I expected varied distance shots, not just medium shots. The train scene Cinematography was the best in the film.Editing and Pace: The editing is arguably the weakest element of ""Madame Web,"" with its rapid cuts and disjointed flow detracting significantly from the storytelling. This lack of coherence makes it challenging for the audience to fully engage with the narrative.Plot and Overall Execution: The storyline of ""Madame Web"" is cluttered and clichéd, suffering from a lack of originality and clear direction. The film's ambition is evident, but the execution falls short of creating a compelling narrative.The Conclusion:""Madame Web"" presents a paradoxical experience, with exceptional music and sound design standing that sharply contrasts with its various flaws in editing, cinematography, and direction.Although there are some visually and emotionally stunning moments, they are frequently overshadowed by a lack of coherence and clarity.Also, I think this film would be reasonable and great to be incorporated in a TV series which would have allowed for a more in-depth exploration of characters and plot.Nevertheless, Madame Web is a bit of a mixed bag, with moments of potential that ultimately leave the viewer something different visually.Rating: 3/10.","3","15 February 2024"
"Skruffbagg","Cannon, is that you in disguise?I firmly believe Madame Web will go down in history as not only the worst superhero movie, but also one of the worst movies ever made. It's that bad. It's absolutely fascinating to behold.Now, I'll be honest with you here. I only went to see this because I had heard it was an unmitigated disaster that had to be seen to be believed, and it truly does not disappoint - or massively does, depending on your viewpoint.It takes a special kind of director to get such cringe-inducing performances out of a fairly talented cast (Dakota Johnson and Tahar Rahim are both quality actors with the right script and direction), but SJ Clarkson somehow manages to wrangle the absolute worst imaginable from every single person in the film. I'll be very surprised if she ever does another feature after this.Nothing in this film works; the plot is moronic, the script seems like it was written by a teenager, the cinematography is horrendous, the aformentioned embarrassing performances, the audio editing is baffling (so much dubbing, brain-melting music choices). I'm amazed this didn't get shelved the minute the final cut was done.To me, I rate this as ""so bad it's good"" as I wasn't bored watching it, but most people I assume will say it's just plain bad... and it is, but very entertainingly so.If you love watching a 2hr car crash then I highly recommend this. The awfulness is mind-boggling in it's complexity, but in the best possible way. Film scholars and historians will be analysing this movie for years to come, and I hope it is talked about in the same vein as The Room in the future.An absolutely epic misfire on all levels.","1","20 February 2024"
"MiroslavKyuranov","It's astonishing to think that Sony could put out a worse product than 2022's Morbius, but boy, ""Madame Web"" manages it. It is an embarrassing mess. Talented stars wasted on probably one of the worst comic book movie ever (which nobody asked for). Filled with atrocious dialogue, awkward editing and laughable structure. It's a clunky, poorly-written, messy, and sloppy movie packed with some mediocre editing and performances.The concept is interesting on paper, but it couldn't be saved due to it's terrible execution. ""Madame Web"" simply lacked the spark it needed in nearly every dept.There is simply nothing memorable in this movie, except maybe some superhero costumes, but that doesn't redeem the fact that the movie is bad.So yeah...""Madame Web"" is yet another disappointing entry in the Sony's Spider-Less universe. It's like a love letter to an era of superhero films that people largely want to forget. The ""Pepsi"" adds are stand-out, it falls short of what could have been a decent movie in the hands of someone else twenty years ago.","4","14 February 2024"
"darrelltill","There is nothing good in this film. It's badly written - not just full of clichés but full of dialogue that is meant to sound like cliché superhero idioms yet butchered until they make no sense. It is nothing but a costume parade with players that are dead behind the eyes. You can tell that everybody involved knows it's going to be a stinker but they'd already signed on and it was too late. It would be great if this was the flop that made Disney rethink their output (I know, this is actually an SSU movie not an MCU movie, but they are all heading down the same path) but I fear it will take a few more. The solution is really simple - they need to adjust their hiring policy to include persons of talent.","1","15 February 2024"
"movieman6-413-929510","Madame Web is a new spin-off set in the Marvel Spider-Man world. This spin-off is directed, partly written and produced by S. J. Clarkson. Before this film, she directed more TV series episodes of superhero shows such as Jessica Jones and The Defenders.Cassandra Webb (Dakota Johnson) works as a paramedic in New York and learns after an accident that she has superpowers to see future possibilities. She sees that the lives of three girls are threatened by a mysterious masked man with spider-like powers.This is why she tries to protect the three girls and must convince them that their lives are really in danger. To truly protect them, they must ensure that the three listen to her and learn to work together.The story of this film has an interesting concept, but the final story and screenplay were written by five different writers. These writers do not always seem to have been on the same page, because the story sometimes seems a bit rushed or frayed. It sometimes seems as if they didn't really know what exactly to do with it, or what the film studio despised of them. The screenplay has also been rewritten many times, so the cast members could no longer always follow exactly where they were going or supposed to do with the film.Despite these messy, rushed aspects, the film remains on a familiar, predictable side for a superhero film. This can make the film seem a bit long-winded or embarrassing. The film is reminiscent of other superhero films that came out around the year 2000, but of a somewhat lesser quality.The visual effects don't always look believable either. The blue screen and CGI can be seen in the film. For some of the cast members, this was also the first time they had actually worked in a film with such visual effects. The fact that they have little or no experience with these film situations is sometimes reflected in their acting.The poor script also gives the cast members few opportunities to make something special of their roles. Dakota Johnson also seemed a bit uncomfortable during promotions of the film, or ignorant of how to properly promote this film. In the final film she tries to make the best of the role and tries to add some comedy to the role, but she doesn't always get the chance to do this. Sydney Sweeney, Isabela Merced and Celeste O'Connor play the three girls Cassandra tries to protect. All three are given a little time to give their characters some personalities, but unfortunately not enough to make you as a viewer really care about the three. For a better focused film, they might have been better off using a character in the story, who Cassandra then has to protect. Tahar Rahim plays the villain in the film, who tries to kill the three girls, but also deals with the poor, weak script. As a result, he does not emerge as strongly as the villain of the story. They also didn't incorporate his audio work well into the film, because his lips sometimes don't always match what his character is saying.With all these superhero spin-off films from the Sony film studio, they only make Marvel's current film series more messy. If Sony and Disney Marvel try to collaborate on the same film series, they will have to consult each other more and better and plan where they want to go with this film series.","2","17 February 2024"
"ethanbresnett","Based on Madame Web's woeful reviews I was expecting this film to be an utter car crash. To its credit I will say it isn't entirely without merit, but it is incredibly boring and bland.Mostly this is because nothing particularly happens. It's a superhero movie with little to no superhero action and a painfully long set up for an underwhelming final act. The characters are so underdeveloped that there is no emotional connection or investment in any of them. Everything about the story and writing just feels lazy, vacuous and corny.Then there's the villain who is utterly uninspiring. He is constantly complaining about 'everything he has built' being destroyed. What has he built you might ask? The film has no interest in exploring this question. He's easily one of the more two dimensional and weak superhero villains I've ever seen committed to screen.Perhaps the most heinous crime this movie commits is to waste the talents of Dakota Johnson, Sydney Sweeney, Adam Scott, Emma Roberts, Zosia Mamet and more. Such a good cast was assembled and they were given absolutely nothing to work with, so I don't blame the performers. It's just such a shame to see such great talent put to the sword like this.As if all of this wasn't enough, the movie also feels remarkably low budget and feels excruciatingly long despite its relatively short runtime.Ultimately I think this film suffered because it was clearly intended as a set up for a wider Spider-Woman franchise which is unlikely to come to fruition. There seemed to be no interest in making a good stand alone movie, and no respect for the audience. A massive waste of time.","3","21 February 2024"
"vfphvnpp","I understand what the plan was here. They wanted a trippy film, focusing on a strong future for the Sony verse. The problem is the delivery. The camera work in this movie made it quite irritating to follow, as there was constant quick close up shots of the action. The dialogue was awful, and there was quite a lot of blatant voice over during the villain scenes.So much wasted time was given to boring scenes in the movie, which led me to believe the screen writers finished the script and realised that it was under the word count.Honestly the acting quality was quite poor across the board, especially the villain, who honestly seems as if they didn't cast for his role at all, just picked up someone off the side of the road.For someone who's guilty pleasure is watching bad movies, I it was a painful time. Don't recommend.","2","14 February 2024"
"jtorch-11283","Don't waste your time, and money seeing this in theaters. I was fooled by the trailer which looked promising. All the action in the whole film ( a total of 2 scenes) is shown in the the trailer. The rest of the movie is just terrible acting trying to save an even worse scrip.I'm honestly not sure how this made it to the big screen. I'm not a cinema expert, but shouldn't someone have to view the finished product and give the O. K. At some point before it is ""audience ready?"" I feel like that step in the process was skipped. I don't know what Marvel had to do with this film, but it certainly isn't the Iron-Man-Marvel I keep hoping they will somehow revive.And to whom it may concern, ""my parents don't love me."" Is neither a solid backstory OR a strong character trait. I hope you eat a lot of money on this movie.","1","15 February 2024"
"cosby_don","I don't know where to start-actually, I do! THIS IS THE WORST MOVIE IN THE HISTORY OF HUMANITY. I'm not kidding.I'm not sure what other movie this Dakota Johnson has been in, but after watching THIS movie, I'll probably never support her again. This was an absolute career killer. Ms. Johnson, please FIRE your agent immediately.To the production crew, editors, director, and ESPECIALLY the writers (I counted 4 writers-that's RIDICULOUS), shame on you for contributing to this mess. It's obvious you've traded in your morals for a paycheck. That's Hollywood for ya'.Did I mention that this movie was HORRENDOUSLY bad? Everything about this movie was bad-there are ZERO redeeming qualities.The story: STUPID. Worst I've ever seen, seriously. Madam Web ask the girls to wait for 3 hours in the woods? STUPID.

I could seriously go on and on. I'm not kidding-EVERYTHING in this movie was STUPID. I can't count how many times I shook my head and said ""This is so bad.""The acting? Very wooden. Ms. Dakota Johnson's acting chops were the worst of the worst here. I really pray that she's done work much better. The other girls-they tried. Jokes fell flat, and they said the DUMBEST lines ever in a movie. I was seriously angry at how dumb they were.The villain? The most generic, uninteresting, uncool villain over ever seen on film.

"rgkarim","LIKES:The Commentary At Times
-Some lines in this movie are startling at how funny they were for me, a fantastic bout of teenage emotions with a less than thrilled babysitter.-Madame Web's origin story is almost like an anti-hero tale to Charles Xavier idea, and though it's not fully fleshed out, there is emotion, fun, and what felt natural angst and vulnerability into it.-With the right timing, and build up, this section of commentary was a striking positive in this reviewers book.Representation of Paramedics
-It's a rare thing to get to actually see E. M. T's in their work and what they give to serve the public.-While a bit forced, and perhaps a tad overdone and cheesy, kudos for Madame Web accomplishing some detailed shots of them serving the public and giving a little character development with it.-There were great avenues taken to help ingrain parts into the story, and with that, the medical nerd inside me found a cool little nod in those sequences.Some Artistic Visuals Are Cool
-I'm a sucker for a good shot and a good artistic visual popping out and ingraining itself into my mind.-Madame Web has some of these moments for me, the creepy and yet serene world of the Web World, being one that holds majesty and mystery, but also the very emotions of the person trying to wield it.-Other shots of costume crusaders striking that right pose, or perhaps that nostalgic early 2000s look, really help establish some of the themes of the movie or a good set up visual to cascade into.-It may be sprinkled about, but there were some superhero visuals that accomplished the job for me in Madame Web.Talented Cast
-Celeste O'Connor is very fun in this movie. A tad quirky, but she keeps the attitude going, a lot of that sass very fun and usually well-placed to help move the story towards forced comedy and obvious story telling.-Merced eventually grew on me after she got into the meat of her character and starting to push past the stubborn and cheeky attitude. She's got charming charisma, a fun brainy side to exploit, and this sadness that she uses to illicit such emotion, something I wanted more of, but got only little.-Sweeney is fun in this movie. Toned down from the other roles I've seen, the woman knows how to adapt her style and give me something to hook to several times. I love the awkwardness she brings, the tie in to the two extremes, and her surprising smallness after she plays such big roles.-And Johnson is about the same as she always is. A snarky and condescending nature that she wields expertly, but a tad dry at times that some lines feel unfulfilled. Fortunately, she's got good chemistry with the girls that assisted in smoothing out the faults.Some Surprising Character Arcs
-The movie may miss a lot of things, but there are a few moments that work very well to show the potential of Madame Web if given the right focus.-An opening that holds some merit was one of the victories, something that would eventually bleed into plot points further on that gave you a very touching moment.-And another element has the other's origin stories granting us some potential hurt and relatable tales to latch onto and acknowledge. Again, helping give a young and in your face Charlie's Angel group some vim and vigor.The Music
-Call me a sucker for nostalgia, Madame Web has a mix of songs that were perfect for viewers like me to enjoy.-Comedic use of the songs are not the most creative, but add that minor element to help give the girls a little more dynamic and believability.-While other times, it's just a blast of the speakers and me dancing in my seat as the forgotten wonder returns for another run to get things started.DISLIKES:The Pacing Uneven
-Despite the trinkets and some merits to the story, Madame Web's dislikes for me start with the pacing of the tale.-A moderately slow start did little to keep me engaged, only to then have these sprints of faster moments to try to change things up, before hitting the brakes again.-Like a CW season crammed into one, Madame Web's pacing feels a lot like dressed up teenage drama trying to give realism and gradual steps, but really just being the mashup of the uglier time use dramas can get stuck to.The Stale Mechanic
-From the trailers, you know there is some type of vision gimmick that Cassie is supposed to use to protect her charges.-That gimmick gets stale very quickly for a viewer like me, the convoluted presentation starting out fun at first, but then turning into annoying déjà vu that felt more like reshoots than actual artistic twisting.-Like Moon Knight, that element makes sense at first, but really could have stopped halfway through the movie once the viewers has connected the powers.-Had there been a bit more excitement, fighting, or even better storytelling to distract, it would have been less impactful, but alas, for me, all the other limitations added up.Lack of Other Character Development
-There are a lot of characters in this movie, some played by bigger names than the leads themselves. And yet, their time and character development felt shoehorned than planned out.-Adam Scott and Emma Roberts seem disengaged, with stories that are cliché, simplistic, and a waste of talent that again showed potential with that slower pacing at the start.-But even the villain and main girls tales feel very bland, and that lack of character development was very much felt by me that it almost seems to rely heavily on another movie to do these characters justice.Annoying Dialogue
-I know, I said the commentary was good, but that was a small amount of it compared to the whole.-Madame Web's dialogue seems to have gone through the writing grinder several times, very loaded with one liners, sassy comments and attitude that seemed to be out of place for much of the film for me.-Statements of the obvious, corny dialogue essentially pushed in with too simplistic of writing and in your face, overdramatic flair to count as quality dialogue. It needs tuning up, needs to be less forceful, and try to add a little Hollywood magic to help tenderize it to something matching a comic book movie.A Villain Needing A Lot More
-Don't get me wrong, there is an element to him that is relatable, believable, and indeed threatening in terms of the madness of his actions.-But outside of this and the opening scene, Ezekiel is a very bland bad guy who just didn't get the time to shine outside of crawling and repeating the same lines over and over.-The direction failed to give him any recognizable skills, his threats empty most of the time and sort of creepy obsessive, and dare I say his actual character is zoomed over and practically absent but for the opening line.-To me, that's a limited villain and one major flaw that much of the movie suffers from.Visuals Get Really Muddy/Bad
-Sony makes such great looking video games, and yet their movies still suffer from last gen effects
-While the artistic flair of those moments was enjoyable, they did have that faux effect that dropped some of the realism this movie was going for.-Even worse, there are lots of movements, character renderings, and powers that leave a lot to be desired in looking their best. I won't say it's a dealbreaker, but it doesn't help to have such limited technology presentation.Scenes/Story Seem Very Chopped Up
-Between the gimmicks and pacing, the scenes already feel limited, messy, and almost like an abbreviated version of what they could be.-Sure, the dialogue gives you everything they are going for, but the presentation felt very much like a lot of reshoots of the same scene, and slight changes that made little difference.-Such indecisive direction and edits got away from them and left me just wondering what this film could have been with half the gimmicks of the visions pulled back.The Action Is Very Boring
-No denying this, Madame Web maybe even worse than many of the CW attempts at action.-While witty, and an amusing game of cat and mouse, a Spiderverse without a solid one or two fights is a verse I'm not fond playing in for nearly two hours.-A lame villain does little but strut and crawl, while our cast somehow running away and eluding comes off a bit pathetic than entertaining.-Even the climax is a mess, rushed finishes, suspense of disbelief, and an overdramatic battle of words with a very extravagant and mushy ending to cap it off.-Eternals at least had a few moves that had me rocking in my seat, but this... this was a challenge to stay awake in.The VERDICT:
Madame Web is certainly not the worst movie I've seen in years, but that doesn't mean Sony's latest is a masterpiece either. There are elements of this vision that show the potential for a good future, but need a lot of work to make up for this rushed installment. A talented cast, music and some fun writing can be the starting building blocks, but it can't offset what feels like lots of production limitations, rewrites, and editing that greatly show in this movie. Boring battles, annoying gimmicks, and under developed characters despite a strong cast were just some of the limitations this movie has to work through if a series is to come with it. Should one see it in theaters? Not really. A shot at home, I would say sure, but with all of this, my scores for the movie are:Action/Adventure/Sci-Fi: 6.0
Movie Overall: 5.0.","5","15 February 2024"
"eddie_baggins","I'm not ashamed to admit I've seen some movies in my time.I am however ashamed to admit curiosity got the better of me and I ended up in an almost entirely empty cinema screening (thanks to one tolerant movie buddy who joined me on my trip to the local cinema) partaking in what can only be described as one of the most universally panned Hollywood blockbusters of the modern era.Not at all interested in watching another Sony Marvel outing after their last few efforts, hearing about the insanely awesome awfulness of Madame Web from friends, internet identities and esteemed critics made me want to witness a potential all-time cringe-fest and while when people are absolutely right in their hyperbole around just how bad Madame Web is, I'm still trying to comprehend how I could possibly testify to just how bad things are here.Directed by long time TV episode director S. J. Clarkson and featuring a cast of performers who have all proven over time to be more than capable of bringing the goods, Madame Web is not devoid of talent that may have been able to salvage some type of goodness from an offence against the entire cinematic medium but as a finished? (Honestly I am unsure how anyone could claim this is an acceptable final version, just watch for some of the most flawed examples of ADR you're ever going to see) product there was no one or any thing that could've saved this nightmare from the fate it had created for itself.An experience that could only possibly come from a collective group who all gave up the fight to save it long before shooting had wrapped, Madame Web inexcusably comes from the same penmanship that was guilty of unleashing Morbius on us but screenwriters Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless at least managed to find some cult like goodness in Jared Leto and Matt Smith's wildly OTT characters and bizarre action segments but Madame Web is nothing more than two hours of terrible plot, characters, spectacle and intentions and there is quite literally no valid reason for this movie to exist in the form it has been given.One of the most atrociously acted Hollywood films ever captured, with lead Dakota Johnson unable to hold back her disdain for a film she clearly hated being a part of and poor old Tahar Rahim taking the films most unfortunate mantle from a wigged Sydney Sweeney, Madame Web may have been promoted as some type of intense action thriller following the exploits of Johnson's Cassandra Webb as she battles Rahim's Ezekiel Sims alongside Sweeney's Julia, Isabela Merced's Anya and Celeste O'Connor's Mattie but we get something else entirely that is hard to come to terms with.From some of the most detestable and frequent examples of product placement that becomes instantly iconic (some viewers may find themselves attempting to crack open a Pepsi can in their Calvin Klein's after a viewing), a villain we literally know nothing about with zero attempts to bother explaining his plans or background, an embarrassing use of comic staple characters that aren't even put into action outside of dream sequences and a script that must surely have been conjured on ChatGPT, Madame Web is a cesspool of Hollywood excrement that isn't even funny in its horribleness, just merely sad and depressing.The only justifiable reason for Madame Web to be the film it is as it stands is if Sony are deliberately attempting to sabotage their Marvel property that no longer is allowed to include many fan favourites, if they aren't in fact doing that there is zero excuses for why Madame Web has ever been allowed to be birthed into existence.An irredeemable, amateurish and embarrassing exercise in pointless, Madame Web is a shockingly bad example of blockbuster filmmaking that is the exact type of bottom feeder product the cinema industry and the Marvel brand didn't need at this particular point of time.Final Say -If you're a glutton for punishment and want to be reminded of everything you wouldn't wish to see in a supposed piece of big screen entertainment then Madame Web is for you! A truly iconic new addition to the staples of all-time misfires, nothing could prepare one for the garbage that is this $80 million dollar disasterpiece.0 fireworks to the head out of 5.Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)","1","22 February 2024"
"shaikhirshad-41223","Literally I had zero expectations when I went to watch this flick but I still thought that something should be good in this to watch at least one time because of marvel name in it. But this movie is so low and looks like low budget CGI thriller and a comedy in the name of superhero genre.I mean from the start itself movie lost it's pace and story and god only knows what are they showing no interest in the screenplay and the plot is not even engaging to watch for at least 30 mins.I only went for Dakota & Sydney just because the screen presence of them looks good, but the director loss this opportunity too. Because the character they're playing is so bad and not even proper dialogues are given and just they have made a common character with no story arc just the situation that they have to act
I've never seen such a bad cinematography of any film it looks like they don't have any interest making this film so they just made a spoof just to show that we are making a movie. Don't know what to say more because this film is that bad.Overall a Boring fest and a spoof fo a superhero genre.","2","16 February 2024"
"vengeance20","Ok, so before people come at me with the ""YoU dIdN't LiKe It BeCaUsE iT wAs FeMaLe LeAd."" chestnut. I went into this one with an open mind, but expecting it to be as described & the reviews were right. The film is bad.The film sees Cassandra Webb who is a New York metropolis paramedic who begins to demonstrate signs of clairvoyance. Forced to challenge revelations about her past, she needs to safeguard 3 young girls from a deadly adversary who wants them destroyed.I found the film to be pretty bad. It's disjointed, clunky, poorly paced & just feels very awkward & stiff. The characters are personality-less, they look & sound as if they're reciting their lines from cue cards (almost robotic, I might add) & the script reads like a supermarket shopping receipt.The films story is all over the place, confusing & hard to follow. The premonition sequences the main lead experiences were annoying & while creative, were repetitive to the point where you couldn't tell if she was hallucinating or actually seeing what she was seeing.The films runtime is overly long for what it is, while not as bad as other films which are generally over 2 hours (rolls eyes), this film felt longer & as I said was too long for what it was at 1 hour & 48 minutes (108 minutes) without credits & the pacing, jeez... don't get me started.The actors were alright, but what they were given script wise, didn't work & made them come across as flat. There's some action & not bad effects to be had, but that's pretty much the only redeeming features from this flick, sadly. It hasn't a lot going for it & is pretty lack luster & basic.Don't get me wrong, I prefer films with straight forward story-lines & plots you can follow, but this one was a bit too basic & could've used more meatiness to beef it up more as well as more emphasis to keep the audience engaged with the story, characters, action etc.I generally didn't like the film & the ending is just out there too & is pretty cringy like some of the scenes in the film as well as the few cringy action sequences themselves among some of the good action we got.Overall, it's a bad film. And no, it's got nothing to do with the old chestnut of me being a man who doesn't like the film because it's female lead. The film was bad & had plenty of things wrong with it. People in general, men & women, boys & girls, didn't like this flick.The story is bland, boring & paper thin like the characters & leads, the little bit of good action & effects seen are overshadowed by the aforementioned issues as well as the other issues like the poor runtime, pacing & the lacking engagement the film has.Also, for those who can't seem to get it in their heads, there's been plenty of female lead films in the past that have done well, from the Alien Franchise to The Hunger Games along with Elektra, Tomb Raider, Salt, Lucy, Hanna etc. I could go on but that's my rant for those who need calling out.2/10.","2","20 February 2024"
"izadyardariush","I could tell from the beginning, making this movie was a bad idea. After I saw the cast I could tell this movie doomed. I have nothing against any of those actors but I must say casting a Dakota was a biggest mistake for the role! Anyone read the comics could say that. This movie was like terminator meeting final destination! No good story, big mess, lot of waste of potentials. I must say worst choice of villain!

"alindsayal","With Marvel Studios taking on more responsibility involving Spider-Man, Sony have decided to try and build a universe involving smaller characters from the same lore as him. We have had Venom and Morbius and will get Kraven The Hunter later this year but here we have Madame Web. I saw this film last night and here is my review for Madame Web. The p[remise of the film sees a women bestowed with powers where she has to save 3 girls from being killed by a villainous foe.Main Character
I must be honest that I have never been a huge fan of Dakota Johnson and she plays Cassandra Web here and I have to be honest she isn't particularly good here. She is overacting everything here and her character is super unlikeable and hard to care about. She is clearly hampered by the awful writing in this film and she can't rise above it and give us a lead role to support or care about and Cassie Web will go down as one of the worst leads in a comic book film ever.Supporting Characters
Sydney Sweeney, Isabela Merced & Celeste O'Connor play the three girls that are in the view of the villain and they are all pretty awful. Their characters are really awkward and not particularly likeable, the film tries to force you to like and care about these characters but it comes across poorly and these actresses aren't good enough to make me care.Tahar Rahim plays Ezekiel Sims and he is one of the more frustrating parts of this film because I have seen him be a good actor and this character had some potential but the film really flops here and makes him this over the top villain that is so stupid that it really takes you out of the film.Adam Scott as Ben Parker is probably the best person here but he isn't really given much to do and it still upsets me that he plays Ben Parker and it is really clear that this was just done to provide some stupid fan service that actually annoys me even more.Story
The story is nonsensical and completely stupid. The plot makes no sense and characters do things that make no sense, Cassie Web in particular is one of the dumbest characters that I have seen in recent movies. This film also tries its best to ruin the character of Spider-Man even though he isn't in the film and it is just the backdrop to this pretty dull and horrendous adventure.Script
This is a really awfully written film. Things make no sense, characters are unlikeable and there is no humour here at all. There are so many plot holes it is crazy and the film has nothing interesting about it at all.Style
I mean I guess the action scenes are okay and the bad guys suit was okay but that is it. The film is filmed really poorly, the editing looks unfinished and at times it is actually quite jarring to watch it. There are way too many jump scares especially for a film that is not a horror film. The trailer shows things that barely happen in the film and it feels like we were sold a different film that never got made.Overall
Overall, Madame Web is a truly disastrous film. This is up there with one of the worst films I have ever seen and is up there with the worst comic book films of all time. Though I am glad I saw this film to have this experience but at all cost avoid this garbage and do something better for 2 hours.Rating - 1/10.","1","16 February 2024"
"daisukereds","A baby-sitting movie in a Superhero setting, where the lead can see the future and has to prevent NOT-Spiderman from killing teenagers (because he has dreams/visions about them). The girls run and hide around a lot, some BS happens and then the movie ends.The foundation of the script is heavily written around a hollow core of ""parents and children"". The cinematography is actually good, and at least ""teaches"" how to do CPR. It also does away with showing premonitions every time something is to be changed near the end.. respecting the viewers intelligence in at least that aspect! And it's easy to follow (if you don't fall asleep) with how simplistic it is.Aside from that, it is barely anything else..
The movie itself isn't terrible.. it's just beyond bland and boring. Also, calling this a Superhero movie is really disingenuous and a marketing ploy to get people to see it. Stay home! There are no good action sequences and nobody is written memorably....
Venom making money was a mistake. Sony has half a franchise, and they can't get anyone talented enough to do something with it. And what they continue to release seems like high-budgeted fan fiction!","3","16 February 2024"
"isaacsundaralingam","Yea, this was garbage and that's saying plenty. It's actually adorable how little anyone cared about ""Madame Web"" - not just the audience, but the filmmakers and actors themselves. Written by the same people who wrote ""Morbius"", this movie is yet another reason to not let them anywhere near a writing software ever again.Not only was the movie unwatchable due to how lifeless it was, but it was also criminally boring. You're waiting for something to happen and you keep waiting right until the credits start to roll. Nothing about the movie was compelling, the plot was riddled with plot holes, the screenplay was lazy, the dialogues were dead and the acting was almost as if the actors were held captive and being forced to act as if everything was okay. It reeks of corporate greed and there isn't a single positive thing to say about this movie.We're only a month and half into the year and we already have a very strong contender for what might be the worst movie of the year, and it's not even close. Don't watch it, but if you do indeed decide to, I hope you lived a life well enough to have a crowded funeral.","1","19 February 2024"
"syntory","Look at the profiles for the writers that wrote Madame Web. You'll see virtually every movie they've written has a bad rating and bad reviews. Why then does Hollywood continually hire these same writers for these big budget films? I could understand if they wrote movies for Asylum Films because all their movies are terrible.Madame Web is god awful! Very difficult to sit through. None of the main characters are likeable. Even the villain is lame. It seems like the entire movie was written to set up a sequel. But why would people spend money to see the sequel of a movie that is one of the worst movies ever written? I'm shocked at how bad this movie is and if there is a sequel I certainly wont bother watching it.Stop hiring bad writers, Hollywood!","2","15 February 2024"
"MovieWarfare","I would absolutely love to be in these Sony meetings because I am absolutely baffled how things like Madame Web are getting greenlit.Madame Web is one of the worst superhero movies ever made! It has terrible writing, characters, action setpieces and even acting. Dakota Johnson is so dull and boring as the main lead but this is probably down to the terrible script.To be fair, the movie does have an interesting concept with this Final Destination x Terminator thing. However, it is so poorly executed that it makes Morbius look like The Dark Knight.Anyway give me the ""He Was in the Amazon With My Mom When She Was Researching Spiders Right Before She Died"" cut!","1","17 February 2024"
"chenp-54708","Literally one of the worst superhero movies I have ever seen.From the advertisements, I knew this movie wasn't going to be great but still, it surprised me how bad and boring it was. Everything about the direction, writing, characters, technical aspects, and designs are really awful. The writing is poor as there are many concepts, ideas and aspects that are messy and bland. The messy script creates poor dialogue from the cast and the characters are not interesting. The special effects looked even worse than the marketing and all of the performances were pretty bad. I honestly do feel bad for Dakota Johnson cause she is a good actress but she deserves to have better roles then this. It can be said for the same for the rest of the cast members.The uses of product placements are annoying, action moments are dull, and and all in all, it was boring. Superhero movies shouldn't be boring but this really dragged on. It's unfortunate cause female superhero leads are something I love to see more like Wonder Woman and The Old Guard which are pretty fun. But unfortunately, it seemed that it likely isn't going to happen anytime soon.There really isn't anything else to say.Bad.","1","14 February 2024"
"AlsExGal","... when I saw Dakota Johnson was starring in it. Naturally I can't lay the entirety of this hot mess at her feet. But there is some really bad campy acting happening on her part, reminiscent of the Fifty Shades of Grey movies in which she starred. Perhaps it was because the director was more interested in the placement of Pepsi cans than her performance, but I digress.Basically, this movie plays out like the cut scenes from a budget Xbox 360 game. From the ground up this thing just feels designed to fail. It feels almost Producersesque in its approach in just how every aspect is seemingly intentionally mangled, yet no one seems to care. How have we come so full circle to go through the glory of Infinity War/Logan/The Dark Knight to arrive all the way back to Batman and Robin and Catwoman levels of superhero flicks? (Bam!, Pow!, Gosh yes Batman!)How did this movie make it so far that it has an actual release, and no one stopped it? How did this idea get green lit? Why did Sony give 80 million and turn over their valuable IP to the people that wrote Morbius, Gods of Egypt, Dracula Untold and The Last Witch Hunter? How did this get past the writing process and again have that script greenlit? How could no one on the set at any point stop things? How did no one in the editing room point out how bad it looked and how much of a mess it was?But to the suits it's not about art and story. Instead it's about business, and people are just a commodity. It's cheaper to recycle known quantities, and practice nepotism and involve maybe less than talented friends, people you've worked with before, than go out and find artists with worthy stories. They don't care about art, they don't care about stories, they care about making this work for them financially, regardless of loss of reputation with audiences as a whole.Youtuber Chris Stuckmann did a deep dive on the topic of big studios being generally run by folks who came up through management rather than the creative rungs such as writing and directing when he discussed this film. His take is worth watching. For some reason, Chris doesn't do critical movie reviews since he has become a filmmaker, but I can tell by his tone that, like me, he was completely displeased watching this one. I'd avoid it.","2","17 February 2024"
"eoinageary","This is, well I guess this is a movie in the Sony universe that I'm SHOCKED is profitable.The story is all over the place, it's basically about Madame Web who is a paramedic and develops powers and can see into the future, with a current threat she tries to change the future, teaming up with 3 powerful characters who are yet to develop into their full potential so she must shield them and change the future to protect them.Trying not to give the little story that gets told away in the opening there but i have to be vague.What I liked, one or two good scenes, I didn't mind the end, I really liked a lot of the camera work some cool looking shots and a decent Score.But the movie is BAD, it makes Morbius look like The Batman 2022. The acting is lacking, the actors look as bored as you will feel. Script is bad, just some beyond silly lines, the story chops and changes so much your neck will hurt you, some bad CGI, and just boring action.And before people harp on about ""you don't like it because it's women leads"" no, it's just a crap film, I enjoyed the marvels, Black Widow was decent, so no, the movie regardless of its leads is just poor.Extremely disappointing, 3/10.","3","14 February 2024"

"hotrobinproductions","Horrible from beginning to end, the opening scene just reeks of awful predictability from story & plot to the core. You know exactly what will happen before it even happens, the script sucks & the dialogue is even worse. There is quite noticeable audio dub edited after the fact too. This budget is 80 million, not that budget matters, because no amount of money could have saved this train wreck, but I mention this because you can still make a good film on lower budgets, Shazam, the first one, had the same budget & delt with a lot of side characters too, it's miles better, Godzilla minus one had a extremely low budget too. But this 80 million dollar film not just effects but production, feels obviously cheap, it almost feels like watching a very long pilot episode to a CW tv show.You thought Morbius was bad, that film was bad because it did the bare minimum, this film doesn't even do the bare minimum, it goes beyond comprehension below that, it just enters a point of no originality or ambition towards creating anything. There isn't even a single superhero moment, even horrible films like catwoman or Morbius has superhero moments & action, this thing doesn't, you get instead visions of the future to potentially set up sequels.This movie also has a serious problem of product placement, it's a long commercial, to be exact a long Pepsi commercial, I feel like Pepsi stopped the halftime show so they could invest in the product placement in this film. This movie was more important to them than the superbowl LOL it's just so over the top & obviously placed way too much in this film. Calvin Klein, Chase bank, the list goes on. This movie should be called superhero product placement the movie.It's barely even close to a 1/10 the cool moments are seeing what we already saw in the trailer when she's seeing the future & you think it's happening now but then it goes back to the moment she realizes it's a vision, granted it's cool the first couple times but it gets old REAL quick. & it ends up getting annoying because it's abused way too much.Thats about it, there isn't any redeeming things in this film, the acting isn't even good. I would say the 3 side character spider women that Dakota finds when they are together there was a potential spark. I saw the talent & potential, but they are failed big time by such a horrid script that the spark never even sparks, it's just like showing you the matches & gasoline & not setting the fire.Madame M0RBIUS / 10.","1","16 February 2024"
"olcare","It's the worst movie and superhero adaptation I've watched in recent years. Completely atrocious effects, atrocious screenplay, and atrocious acting. Also, a big insult to all comic book readers and those who know the original story.Let me describe the movie simply. First of all, I am filled with hatred; I really want to curse the entire creative team for this unacceptable film.All the performances are bad, everyone. There's not a single good actor trying; everyone just took the role for money. It's a terrible disgrace, a total eclipse of reason.The screenplay is the worst superhero screenplay I've ever seen. It barely resembles the original story, and if there aren't scenes like the other Spider-Girls in the trailer, why include them? There's no such obligation; instead, write a decent screenplay. All action scenes are full of logical errors; they've written it without thinking, it's complete garbage.Apart from these, the direction, sorry to say, is garbage too. Most scenes are shot as if they were taken straight from a phone camera; action scenes are not shown, they're hidden due to the atrociousness of the effects. It's shameful.After these general points, Sony urgently needs to cancel this universe; the original stories are garbage, there's no logic, no connection anywhere. They're just being shot randomly. I don't like to curse, but I hope this film sinks at the box office.The last scene with Madame Web gaining her powers, those web effects, clinging to souls, it's unbelievable how you approved this film, may God punish you.I don't know which one to talk about; all the atrocities are collected in this film. Whether it's the woman going to Peru and back in 30 seconds, Spider-Man dodging with fireworks, dancing at the boys' table when my daughters are left alone, not telling the story of the Spider-Human community, or the woman talking normally while giving birth at the end, everything is a disgrace. I hope this universe sinks, and you all get fired. No one involved in the management of this film deserves their job respectfully; they should quit immediately.Note: Dakota Johnson made a statement saying she didn't watch the movie. Why are you serving a completely garbage film if you're not going to watch it? Life shouldn't be all about money for you; we, in our poverty, are trying to watch it, and this is no different from cursing all the audience's families. Shame on you.Note 2: Just now, I looked at the budget of the movie, and my anger grew even more, 80 million dollars EIGHTY MILLION. How can I not believe this money, I really can't believe it, it's nothing but disrespect to yourself, disrespect to the audience, nothing but an insult.","1","16 February 2024"
"sinscopefilms","First Impression:The opening of the Madame Web was immersed in a mystique and ambition, enhanced by great musical score; yet, as the movie progresses, it becomes a mixed bag and a rollercoaster of emotions.The Positive:Musical Score and Sound Design: The standout feature of ""Madame Web"" is its musical score. The soundtrack not only enhances the emotional depth of the film but also succeeds in creating in some moments genuine goosebumps. The sound design really enhances this impact by carefully using sound pans, bass, and reverse effects. It creates a sense of tension and immersion which is one of the film's strongest features.The Mixed:Visual Effects and Costume Design: Some of the visual effects in ""Madame Web"" were visually appealing. The costume design, like Casey's red jacket and the three spider girl villain outfits standing out as particularly stunning contributions to the film's aesthetic, but it was not often shown in the film since the films direction and focus was different. I was disappointed.Acting and Direction: Although I thought Casey's character development - her ability to see the world from a different perspective - was great, I didn't like how it was visually presented. The way it was edited was poorly done. The editor could use 2 distinct color grading features where one sees the future and two, she sees the present moment.However, The performances throughout the film feel lackluster, with the actors appearing confused and disengaged. This, combined with direction that fails to maintain interest or coherence in many scenes, significantly undermines the film's potential.Negatives:Cinematography: Cinematography is bad since some pictures don't show a clear image. The camera moves so fast that I cannot comprehend the picture. I kind of recognized that it tries to initiate the rapidness of the events from the spider's eye point of view but it was a tasteless decision. The Cinematography is not something like wow. The reason why Cinematography was lacking is because it was heavily based on medium closeups and dutch tilts which on one hand was a unique choice but on the other hand very hard to watch. I found the 180 degree round camera rotations super cool, but again, I expected varied distance shots, not just medium shots. The train scene Cinematography was the best in the film.Editing and Pace: The editing is arguably the weakest element of ""Madame Web,"" with its rapid cuts and disjointed flow detracting significantly from the storytelling. This lack of coherence makes it challenging for the audience to fully engage with the narrative.Plot and Overall Execution: The storyline of ""Madame Web"" is cluttered and clichéd, suffering from a lack of originality and clear direction. The film's ambition is evident, but the execution falls short of creating a compelling narrative.The Conclusion:""Madame Web"" presents a paradoxical experience, with exceptional music and sound design standing that sharply contrasts with its various flaws in editing, cinematography, and direction.Although there are some visually and emotionally stunning moments, they are frequently overshadowed by a lack of coherence and clarity.Also, I think this film would be reasonable and great to be incorporated in a TV series which would have allowed for a more in-depth exploration of characters and plot.Nevertheless, Madame Web is a bit of a mixed bag, with moments of potential that ultimately leave the viewer something different visually.Rating: 3/10.","3","15 February 2024"
"Skruffbagg","Cannon, is that you in disguise?I firmly believe Madame Web will go down in history as not only the worst superhero movie, but also one of the worst movies ever made. It's that bad. It's absolutely fascinating to behold.Now, I'll be honest with you here. I only went to see this because I had heard it was an unmitigated disaster that had to be seen to be believed, and it truly does not disappoint - or massively does, depending on your viewpoint.It takes a special kind of director to get such cringe-inducing performances out of a fairly talented cast (Dakota Johnson and Tahar Rahim are both quality actors with the right script and direction), but SJ Clarkson somehow manages to wrangle the absolute worst imaginable from every single person in the film. I'll be very surprised if she ever does another feature after this.Nothing in this film works; the plot is moronic, the script seems like it was written by a teenager, the cinematography is horrendous, the aformentioned embarrassing performances, the audio editing is baffling (so much dubbing, brain-melting music choices). I'm amazed this didn't get shelved the minute the final cut was done.To me, I rate this as ""so bad it's good"" as I wasn't bored watching it, but most people I assume will say it's just plain bad... and it is, but very entertainingly so.If you love watching a 2hr car crash then I highly recommend this. The awfulness is mind-boggling in it's complexity, but in the best possible way. Film scholars and historians will be analysing this movie for years to come, and I hope it is talked about in the same vein as The Room in the future.An absolutely epic misfire on all levels.","1","20 February 2024"
"MiroslavKyuranov","It's astonishing to think that Sony could put out a worse product than 2022's Morbius, but boy, ""Madame Web"" manages it. It is an embarrassing mess. Talented stars wasted on probably one of the worst comic book movie ever (which nobody asked for). Filled with atrocious dialogue, awkward editing and laughable structure. It's a clunky, poorly-written, messy, and sloppy movie packed with some mediocre editing and performances.The concept is interesting on paper, but it couldn't be saved due to it's terrible execution. ""Madame Web"" simply lacked the spark it needed in nearly every dept.There is simply nothing memorable in this movie, except maybe some superhero costumes, but that doesn't redeem the fact that the movie is bad.So yeah...""Madame Web"" is yet another disappointing entry in the Sony's Spider-Less universe. It's like a love letter to an era of superhero films that people largely want to forget. The ""Pepsi"" adds are stand-out, it falls short of what could have been a decent movie in the hands of someone else twenty years ago.","4","14 February 2024"
"darrelltill","There is nothing good in this film. It's badly written - not just full of clichés but full of dialogue that is meant to sound like cliché superhero idioms yet butchered until they make no sense. It is nothing but a costume parade with players that are dead behind the eyes. You can tell that everybody involved knows it's going to be a stinker but they'd already signed on and it was too late. It would be great if this was the flop that made Disney rethink their output (I know, this is actually an SSU movie not an MCU movie, but they are all heading down the same path) but I fear it will take a few more. The solution is really simple - they need to adjust their hiring policy to include persons of talent.","1","15 February 2024"
"movieman6-413-929510","Madame Web is a new spin-off set in the Marvel Spider-Man world. This spin-off is directed, partly written and produced by S. J. Clarkson. Before this film, she directed more TV series episodes of superhero shows such as Jessica Jones and The Defenders.Cassandra Webb (Dakota Johnson) works as a paramedic in New York and learns after an accident that she has superpowers to see future possibilities. She sees that the lives of three girls are threatened by a mysterious masked man with spider-like powers.This is why she tries to protect the three girls and must convince them that their lives are really in danger. To truly protect them, they must ensure that the three listen to her and learn to work together.The story of this film has an interesting concept, but the final story and screenplay were written by five different writers. These writers do not always seem to have been on the same page, because the story sometimes seems a bit rushed or frayed. It sometimes seems as if they didn't really know what exactly to do with it, or what the film studio despised of them. The screenplay has also been rewritten many times, so the cast members could no longer always follow exactly where they were going or supposed to do with the film.Despite these messy, rushed aspects, the film remains on a familiar, predictable side for a superhero film. This can make the film seem a bit long-winded or embarrassing. The film is reminiscent of other superhero films that came out around the year 2000, but of a somewhat lesser quality.The visual effects don't always look believable either. The blue screen and CGI can be seen in the film. For some of the cast members, this was also the first time they had actually worked in a film with such visual effects. The fact that they have little or no experience with these film situations is sometimes reflected in their acting.The poor script also gives the cast members few opportunities to make something special of their roles. Dakota Johnson also seemed a bit uncomfortable during promotions of the film, or ignorant of how to properly promote this film. In the final film she tries to make the best of the role and tries to add some comedy to the role, but she doesn't always get the chance to do this. Sydney Sweeney, Isabela Merced and Celeste O'Connor play the three girls Cassandra tries to protect. All three are given a little time to give their characters some personalities, but unfortunately not enough to make you as a viewer really care about the three. For a better focused film, they might have been better off using a character in the story, who Cassandra then has to protect. Tahar Rahim plays the villain in the film, who tries to kill the three girls, but also deals with the poor, weak script. As a result, he does not emerge as strongly as the villain of the story. They also didn't incorporate his audio work well into the film, because his lips sometimes don't always match what his character is saying.With all these superhero spin-off films from the Sony film studio, they only make Marvel's current film series more messy. If Sony and Disney Marvel try to collaborate on the same film series, they will have to consult each other more and better and plan where they want to go with this film series.","2","17 February 2024"
"ethanbresnett","Based on Madame Web's woeful reviews I was expecting this film to be an utter car crash. To its credit I will say it isn't entirely without merit, but it is incredibly boring and bland.Mostly this is because nothing particularly happens. It's a superhero movie with little to no superhero action and a painfully long set up for an underwhelming final act. The characters are so underdeveloped that there is no emotional connection or investment in any of them. Everything about the story and writing just feels lazy, vacuous and corny.Then there's the villain who is utterly uninspiring. He is constantly complaining about 'everything he has built' being destroyed. What has he built you might ask? The film has no interest in exploring this question. He's easily one of the more two dimensional and weak superhero villains I've ever seen committed to screen.Perhaps the most heinous crime this movie commits is to waste the talents of Dakota Johnson, Sydney Sweeney, Adam Scott, Emma Roberts, Zosia Mamet and more. Such a good cast was assembled and they were given absolutely nothing to work with, so I don't blame the performers. It's just such a shame to see such great talent put to the sword like this.As if all of this wasn't enough, the movie also feels remarkably low budget and feels excruciatingly long despite its relatively short runtime.Ultimately I think this film suffered because it was clearly intended as a set up for a wider Spider-Woman franchise which is unlikely to come to fruition. There seemed to be no interest in making a good stand alone movie, and no respect for the audience. A massive waste of time.","3","21 February 2024"
"vfphvnpp","I understand what the plan was here. They wanted a trippy film, focusing on a strong future for the Sony verse. The problem is the delivery. The camera work in this movie made it quite irritating to follow, as there was constant quick close up shots of the action. The dialogue was awful, and there was quite a lot of blatant voice over during the villain scenes.So much wasted time was given to boring scenes in the movie, which led me to believe the screen writers finished the script and realised that it was under the word count.Honestly the acting quality was quite poor across the board, especially the villain, who honestly seems as if they didn't cast for his role at all, just picked up someone off the side of the road.For someone who's guilty pleasure is watching bad movies, I it was a painful time. Don't recommend.","2","14 February 2024"
"jtorch-11283","Don't waste your time, and money seeing this in theaters. I was fooled by the trailer which looked promising. All the action in the whole film ( a total of 2 scenes) is shown in the the trailer. The rest of the movie is just terrible acting trying to save an even worse scrip.I'm honestly not sure how this made it to the big screen. I'm not a cinema expert, but shouldn't someone have to view the finished product and give the O. K. At some point before it is ""audience ready?"" I feel like that step in the process was skipped. I don't know what Marvel had to do with this film, but it certainly isn't the Iron-Man-Marvel I keep hoping they will somehow revive.And to whom it may concern, ""my parents don't love me."" Is neither a solid backstory OR a strong character trait. I hope you eat a lot of money on this movie.","1","15 February 2024"
"cosby_don","I don't know where to start-actually, I do! THIS IS THE WORST MOVIE IN THE HISTORY OF HUMANITY. I'm not kidding.I'm not sure what other movie this Dakota Johnson has been in, but after watching THIS movie, I'll probably never support her again. This was an absolute career killer. Ms. Johnson, please FIRE your agent immediately.To the production crew, editors, director, and ESPECIALLY the writers (I counted 4 writers-that's RIDICULOUS), shame on you for contributing to this mess. It's obvious you've traded in your morals for a paycheck. That's Hollywood for ya'.Did I mention that this movie was HORRENDOUSLY bad? Everything about this movie was bad-there are ZERO redeeming qualities.The story: STUPID. Worst I've ever seen, seriously. Madam Web ask the girls to wait for 3 hours in the woods? STUPID. The guy partner keeping the girls as Madam Web flies to Peru to check something out. STUPID. Madam a Web getting her powers from a spider bite through her mother. STUPID. I could seriously go on and on. I'm not kidding-EVERYTHING in this movie was STUPID. I can't count how many times I shook my head and said ""This is so bad.""The acting? Very wooden. Ms. Dakota Johnson's acting chops were the worst of the worst here. I really pray that she's done work much better. The other girls-they tried. Jokes fell flat, and they said the DUMBEST lines ever in a movie. I was seriously angry at how dumb they were.The villain? The most generic, uninteresting, uncool villain over ever seen on film. Not one memorable quote. Come to think, did he even make a ""evil guy"" speech? Nope!The ending? Oh my, HORRENDOUS. She's smiling in her glasses while paralyzed in a wheel chair? MAN WHI WROTE THIS MESS??The girls weren't even in costume more than 2 minutes of the entire film, even though in the trailer we came to expect them to be crime fighters and kicking butt in the film.

"rgkarim","LIKES:The Commentary At Times
-Some lines in this movie are startling at how funny they were for me, a fantastic bout of teenage emotions with a less than thrilled babysitter.-Madame Web's origin story is almost like an anti-hero tale to Charles Xavier idea, and though it's not fully fleshed out, there is emotion, fun, and what felt natural angst and vulnerability into it.-With the right timing, and build up, this section of commentary was a striking positive in this reviewers book.Representation of Paramedics
-It's a rare thing to get to actually see E. M. T's in their work and what they give to serve the public.-While a bit forced, and perhaps a tad overdone and cheesy, kudos for Madame Web accomplishing some detailed shots of them serving the public and giving a little character development with it.-There were great avenues taken to help ingrain parts into the story, and with that, the medical nerd inside me found a cool little nod in those sequences.Some Artistic Visuals Are Cool
-I'm a sucker for a good shot and a good artistic visual popping out and ingraining itself into my mind.-Madame Web has some of these moments for me, the creepy and yet serene world of the Web World, being one that holds majesty and mystery, but also the very emotions of the person trying to wield it.-Other shots of costume crusaders striking that right pose, or perhaps that nostalgic early 2000s look, really help establish some of the themes of the movie or a good set up visual to cascade into.-It may be sprinkled about, but there were some superhero visuals that accomplished the job for me in Madame Web.Talented Cast
-Celeste O'Connor is very fun in this movie. A tad quirky, but she keeps the attitude going, a lot of that sass very fun and usually well-placed to help move the story towards forced comedy and obvious story telling.-Merced eventually grew on me after she got into the meat of her character and starting to push past the stubborn and cheeky attitude. She's got charming charisma, a fun brainy side to exploit, and this sadness that she uses to illicit such emotion, something I wanted more of, but got only little.-Sweeney is fun in this movie. Toned down from the other roles I've seen, the woman knows how to adapt her style and give me something to hook to several times. I love the awkwardness she brings, the tie in to the two extremes, and her surprising smallness after she plays such big roles.-And Johnson is about the same as she always is. A snarky and condescending nature that she wields expertly, but a tad dry at times that some lines feel unfulfilled. Fortunately, she's got good chemistry with the girls that assisted in smoothing out the faults.Some Surprising Character Arcs
-The movie may miss a lot of things, but there are a few moments that work very well to show the potential of Madame Web if given the right focus.-An opening that holds some merit was one of the victories, something that would eventually bleed into plot points further on that gave you a very touching moment.-And another element has the other's origin stories granting us some potential hurt and relatable tales to latch onto and acknowledge. Again, helping give a young and in your face Charlie's Angel group some vim and vigor.The Music
-Call me a sucker for nostalgia, Madame Web has a mix of songs that were perfect for viewers like me to enjoy.-Comedic use of the songs are not the most creative, but add that minor element to help give the girls a little more dynamic and believability.-While other times, it's just a blast of the speakers and me dancing in my seat as the forgotten wonder returns for another run to get things started.DISLIKES:The Pacing Uneven
-Despite the trinkets and some merits to the story, Madame Web's dislikes for me start with the pacing of the tale.-A moderately slow start did little to keep me engaged, only to then have these sprints of faster moments to try to change things up, before hitting the brakes again.-Like a CW season crammed into one, Madame Web's pacing feels a lot like dressed up teenage drama trying to give realism and gradual steps, but really just being the mashup of the uglier time use dramas can get stuck to.The Stale Mechanic
-From the trailers, you know there is some type of vision gimmick that Cassie is supposed to use to protect her charges.-That gimmick gets stale very quickly for a viewer like me, the convoluted presentation starting out fun at first, but then turning into annoying déjà vu that felt more like reshoots than actual artistic twisting.-Like Moon Knight, that element makes sense at first, but really could have stopped halfway through the movie once the viewers has connected the powers.-Had there been a bit more excitement, fighting, or even better storytelling to distract, it would have been less impactful, but alas, for me, all the other limitations added up.Lack of Other Character Development
-There are a lot of characters in this movie, some played by bigger names than the leads themselves. And yet, their time and character development felt shoehorned than planned out.-Adam Scott and Emma Roberts seem disengaged, with stories that are cliché, simplistic, and a waste of talent that again showed potential with that slower pacing at the start.-But even the villain and main girls tales feel very bland, and that lack of character development was very much felt by me that it almost seems to rely heavily on another movie to do these characters justice.Annoying Dialogue
-I know, I said the commentary was good, but that was a small amount of it compared to the whole.-Madame Web's dialogue seems to have gone through the writing grinder several times, very loaded with one liners, sassy comments and attitude that seemed to be out of place for much of the film for me.-Statements of the obvious, corny dialogue essentially pushed in with too simplistic of writing and in your face, overdramatic flair to count as quality dialogue. It needs tuning up, needs to be less forceful, and try to add a little Hollywood magic to help tenderize it to something matching a comic book movie.A Villain Needing A Lot More
-Don't get me wrong, there is an element to him that is relatable, believable, and indeed threatening in terms of the madness of his actions.-But outside of this and the opening scene, Ezekiel is a very bland bad guy who just didn't get the time to shine outside of crawling and repeating the same lines over and over.-The direction failed to give him any recognizable skills, his threats empty most of the time and sort of creepy obsessive, and dare I say his actual character is zoomed over and practically absent but for the opening line.-To me, that's a limited villain and one major flaw that much of the movie suffers from.Visuals Get Really Muddy/Bad
-Sony makes such great looking video games, and yet their movies still suffer from last gen effects
-While the artistic flair of those moments was enjoyable, they did have that faux effect that dropped some of the realism this movie was going for.-Even worse, there are lots of movements, character renderings, and powers that leave a lot to be desired in looking their best. I won't say it's a dealbreaker, but it doesn't help to have such limited technology presentation.Scenes/Story Seem Very Chopped Up
-Between the gimmicks and pacing, the scenes already feel limited, messy, and almost like an abbreviated version of what they could be.-Sure, the dialogue gives you everything they are going for, but the presentation felt very much like a lot of reshoots of the same scene, and slight changes that made little difference.-Such indecisive direction and edits got away from them and left me just wondering what this film could have been with half the gimmicks of the visions pulled back.The Action Is Very Boring
-No denying this, Madame Web maybe even worse than many of the CW attempts at action.-While witty, and an amusing game of cat and mouse, a Spiderverse without a solid one or two fights is a verse I'm not fond playing in for nearly two hours.-A lame villain does little but strut and crawl, while our cast somehow running away and eluding comes off a bit pathetic than entertaining.-Even the climax is a mess, rushed finishes, suspense of disbelief, and an overdramatic battle of words with a very extravagant and mushy ending to cap it off.-Eternals at least had a few moves that had me rocking in my seat, but this... this was a challenge to stay awake in.The VERDICT:
Madame Web is certainly not the worst movie I've seen in years, but that doesn't mean Sony's latest is a masterpiece either. There are elements of this vision that show the potential for a good future, but need a lot of work to make up for this rushed installment. A talented cast, music and some fun writing can be the starting building blocks, but it can't offset what feels like lots of production limitations, rewrites, and editing that greatly show in this movie. Boring battles, annoying gimmicks, and under developed characters despite a strong cast were just some of the limitations this movie has to work through if a series is to come with it. Should one see it in theaters? Not really. A shot at home, I would say sure, but with all of this, my scores for the movie are:Action/Adventure/Sci-Fi: 6.0
Movie Overall: 5.0.","5","15 February 2024"
"eddie_baggins","I'm not ashamed to admit I've seen some movies in my time.I am however ashamed to admit curiosity got the better of me and I ended up in an almost entirely empty cinema screening (thanks to one tolerant movie buddy who joined me on my trip to the local cinema) partaking in what can only be described as one of the most universally panned Hollywood blockbusters of the modern era.Not at all interested in watching another Sony Marvel outing after their last few efforts, hearing about the insanely awesome awfulness of Madame Web from friends, internet identities and esteemed critics made me want to witness a potential all-time cringe-fest and while when people are absolutely right in their hyperbole around just how bad Madame Web is, I'm still trying to comprehend how I could possibly testify to just how bad things are here.Directed by long time TV episode director S. J. Clarkson and featuring a cast of performers who have all proven over time to be more than capable of bringing the goods, Madame Web is not devoid of talent that may have been able to salvage some type of goodness from an offence against the entire cinematic medium but as a finished? (Honestly I am unsure how anyone could claim this is an acceptable final version, just watch for some of the most flawed examples of ADR you're ever going to see) product there was no one or any thing that could've saved this nightmare from the fate it had created for itself.An experience that could only possibly come from a collective group who all gave up the fight to save it long before shooting had wrapped, Madame Web inexcusably comes from the same penmanship that was guilty of unleashing Morbius on us but screenwriters Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless at least managed to find some cult like goodness in Jared Leto and Matt Smith's wildly OTT characters and bizarre action segments but Madame Web is nothing more than two hours of terrible plot, characters, spectacle and intentions and there is quite literally no valid reason for this movie to exist in the form it has been given.One of the most atrociously acted Hollywood films ever captured, with lead Dakota Johnson unable to hold back her disdain for a film she clearly hated being a part of and poor old Tahar Rahim taking the films most unfortunate mantle from a wigged Sydney Sweeney, Madame Web may have been promoted as some type of intense action thriller following the exploits of Johnson's Cassandra Webb as she battles Rahim's Ezekiel Sims alongside Sweeney's Julia, Isabela Merced's Anya and Celeste O'Connor's Mattie but we get something else entirely that is hard to come to terms with.From some of the most detestable and frequent examples of product placement that becomes instantly iconic (some viewers may find themselves attempting to crack open a Pepsi can in their Calvin Klein's after a viewing), a villain we literally know nothing about with zero attempts to bother explaining his plans or background, an embarrassing use of comic staple characters that aren't even put into action outside of dream sequences and a script that must surely have been conjured on ChatGPT, Madame Web is a cesspool of Hollywood excrement that isn't even funny in its horribleness, just merely sad and depressing.The only justifiable reason for Madame Web to be the film it is as it stands is if Sony are deliberately attempting to sabotage their Marvel property that no longer is allowed to include many fan favourites, if they aren't in fact doing that there is zero excuses for why Madame Web has ever been allowed to be birthed into existence.An irredeemable, amateurish and embarrassing exercise in pointless, Madame Web is a shockingly bad example of blockbuster filmmaking that is the exact type of bottom feeder product the cinema industry and the Marvel brand didn't need at this particular point of time.Final Say -If you're a glutton for punishment and want to be reminded of everything you wouldn't wish to see in a supposed piece of big screen entertainment then Madame Web is for you! A truly iconic new addition to the staples of all-time misfires, nothing could prepare one for the garbage that is this $80 million dollar disasterpiece.0 fireworks to the head out of 5.Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)","1","22 February 2024"
"shaikhirshad-41223","Literally I had zero expectations when I went to watch this flick but I still thought that something should be good in this to watch at least one time because of marvel name in it. But this movie is so low and looks like low budget CGI thriller and a comedy in the name of superhero genre.I mean from the start itself movie lost it's pace and story and god only knows what are they showing no interest in the screenplay and the plot is not even engaging to watch for at least 30 mins.I only went for Dakota & Sydney just because the screen presence of them looks good, but the director loss this opportunity too. Because the character they're playing is so bad and not even proper dialogues are given and just they have made a common character with no story arc just the situation that they have to act
I've never seen such a bad cinematography of any film it looks like they don't have any interest making this film so they just made a spoof just to show that we are making a movie.

"vengeance20","Ok, so before people come at me with the ""YoU dIdN't LiKe It BeCaUsE iT wAs FeMaLe LeAd."" chestnut. I went into this one with an open mind, but expecting it to be as described & the reviews were right. The film is bad.The film sees Cassandra Webb who is a New York metropolis paramedic who begins to demonstrate signs of clairvoyance. Forced to challenge revelations about her past, she needs to safeguard 3 young girls from a deadly adversary who wants them destroyed.I found the film to be pretty bad. It's disjointed, clunky, poorly paced & just feels very awkward & stiff. The characters are personality-less, they look & sound as if they're reciting their lines from cue cards (almost robotic, I might add) & the script reads like a supermarket shopping receipt.The films story is all over the place, confusing & hard to follow. The premonition sequences the main lead experiences were annoying & while creative, were repetitive to the point where you couldn't tell if she was hallucinating or actually seeing what she was seeing.The films runtime is overly long for what it is, while not as bad as other films which are generally over 2 hours (rolls eyes), this film felt longer & as I said was too long for what it was at 1 hour & 48 minutes (108 minutes) without credits & the pacing, jeez... don't get me started.The actors were alright, but what they were given script wise, didn't work & made them come across as flat. There's some action & not bad effects to be had, but that's pretty much the only redeeming features from this flick, sadly. It hasn't a lot going for it & is pretty lack luster & basic.Don't get me wrong, I prefer films with straight forward story-lines & plots you can follow, but this one was a bit too basic & could've used more meatiness to beef it up more as well as more emphasis to keep the audience engaged with the story, characters, action etc.I generally didn't like the film & the ending is just out there too & is pretty cringy like some of the scenes in the film as well as the few cringy action sequences themselves among some of the good action we got.Overall, it's a bad film. And no, it's got nothing to do with the old chestnut of me being a man who doesn't like the film because it's female lead. The film was bad & had plenty of things wrong with it. People in general, men & women, boys & girls, didn't like this flick.The story is bland, boring & paper thin like the characters & leads, the little bit of good action & effects seen are overshadowed by the aforementioned issues as well as the other issues like the poor runtime, pacing & the lacking engagement the film has.Also, for those who can't seem to get it in their heads, there's been plenty of female lead films in the past that have done well, from the Alien Franchise to The Hunger Games along with Elektra, Tomb Raider, Salt, Lucy, Hanna etc. I could go on but that's my rant for those who need calling out.2/10.","2","20 February 2024"

"alindsayal","With Marvel Studios taking on more responsibility involving Spider-Man, Sony have decided to try and build a universe involving smaller characters from the same lore as him. We have had Venom and Morbius and will get Kraven The Hunter later this year but here we have Madame Web. I saw this film last night and here is my review for Madame Web. The p[remise of the film sees a women bestowed with powers where she has to save 3 girls from being killed by a villainous foe.Main Character
I must be honest that I have never been a huge fan of Dakota Johnson and she plays Cassandra Web here and I have to be honest she isn't particularly good here. She is overacting everything here and her character is super unlikeable and hard to care about. She is clearly hampered by the awful writing in this film and she can't rise above it and give us a lead role to support or care about and Cassie Web will go down as one of the worst leads in a comic book film ever.Supporting Characters
Sydney Sweeney, Isabela Merced & Celeste O'Connor play the three girls that are in the view of the villain and they are all pretty awful. Their characters are really awkward and not particularly likeable, the film tries to force you to like and care about these characters but it comes across poorly and these actresses aren't good enough to make me care.Tahar Rahim plays Ezekiel Sims and he is one of the more frustrating parts of this film because I have seen him be a good actor and this character had some potential but the film really flops here and makes him this over the top villain that is so stupid that it really takes you out of the film.Adam Scott as Ben Parker is probably the best person here but he isn't really given much to do and it still upsets me that he plays Ben Parker and it is really clear that this was just done to provide some stupid fan service that actually annoys me even more.Story
The story is nonsensical and completely stupid. The plot makes no sense and characters do things that make no sense, Cassie Web in particular is one of the dumbest characters that I have seen in recent movies. This film also tries its best to ruin the character of Spider-Man even though he isn't in the film and it is just the backdrop to this pretty dull and horrendous adventure.Script
This is a really awfully written film. Things make no sense, characters are unlikeable and there is no humour here at all. There are so many plot holes it is crazy and the film has nothing interesting about it at all.Style
I mean I guess the action scenes are okay and the bad guys suit was okay but that is it. The film is filmed really poorly, the editing looks unfinished and at times it is actually quite jarring to watch it. There are way too many jump scares especially for a film that is not a horror film. The trailer shows things that barely happen in the film and it feels like we were sold a different film that never got made.Overall
Overall, Madame Web is a truly disastrous film. This is up there with one of the worst films I have ever seen and is up there with the worst comic book films of all time. Though I am glad I saw this film to have this experience but at all cost avoid this garbage and do something better for 2 hours.Rating - 1/10.","1","16 February 2024"
"daisukereds","A baby-sitting movie in a Superhero setting, where the lead can see the future and has to prevent NOT-Spiderman from killing teenagers (because he has dreams/visions about them). The girls run and hide around a lot, some BS happens and then the movie ends.The foundation of the script is heavily written around a hollow core of ""parents and children"". The cinematography is actually good, and at least ""teaches"" how to do CPR. It also does away with showing premonitions every time something is to be changed near the end.. respecting the viewers intelligence in at least that aspect! And it's easy to follow (if you don't fall asleep) with how simplistic it is.Aside from that, it is barely anything else..
The movie itself isn't terrible.. it's just beyond bland and boring. Also, calling this a Superhero movie is really disingenuous and a marketing ploy to get people to see it. Stay home! There are no good action sequences and nobody is written memorably....
Venom making money was a mistake. Sony has half a franchise, and they can't get anyone talented enough to do something with it. And what they continue to release seems like high-budgeted fan fiction!","3","16 February 2024"
"isaacsundaralingam","Yea, this was garbage and that's saying plenty. It's actually adorable how little anyone cared about ""Madame Web"" - not just the audience, but the filmmakers and actors themselves. Written by the same people who wrote ""Morbius"", this movie is yet another reason to not let them anywhere near a writing software ever again.Not only was the movie unwatchable due to how lifeless it was, but it was also criminally boring. You're waiting for something to happen and you keep waiting right until the credits start to roll. Nothing about the movie was compelling, the plot was riddled with plot holes, the screenplay was lazy, the dialogues were dead and the acting was almost as if the actors were held captive and being forced to act as if everything was okay. It reeks of corporate greed and there isn't a single positive thing to say about this movie.We're only a month and half into the year and we already have a very strong contender for what might be the worst movie of the year, and it's not even close. Don't watch it, but if you do indeed decide to, I hope you lived a life well enough to have a crowded funeral.","1","19 February 2024"
"syntory","Look at the profiles for the writers that wrote Madame Web. You'll see virtually every movie they've written has a bad rating and bad reviews. Why then does Hollywood continually hire these same writers for these big budget films? I could understand if they wrote movies for Asylum Films because all their movies are terrible.Madame Web is god awful! Very difficult to sit through. None of the main characters are likeable. Even the villain is lame. It seems like the entire movie was written to set up a sequel. But why would people spend money to see the sequel of a movie that is one of the worst movies ever written? I'm shocked at how bad this movie is and if there is a sequel I certainly wont bother watching it.Stop hiring bad writers, Hollywood!","2","15 February 2024"

It has terrible writing, characters, action setpieces and even acting. Dakota Johnson is so dull and boring as the main lead but this is probably down to the terrible script.To be fair, the movie does have an interesting concept with this Final Destination x Terminator thing. However, it is so poorly executed that it makes Morbius look like The Dark Knight.Anyway give me the ""He Was in the Amazon With My Mom When She Was Researching Spiders Right Before She Died"" cut!","1","17 February 2024"
"chenp-54708","Literally one of the worst superhero movies I have ever seen.From the advertisements, I knew this movie wasn't going to be great but still, it surprised me how bad and boring it was. Everything about the direction, writing, characters, technical aspects, and designs are really awful. The writing is poor as there are many concepts, ideas and aspects that are messy and bland. The messy script creates poor dialogue from the cast and the characters are not interesting. The special effects looked even worse than the marketing and all of the performances were pretty bad. I honestly do feel bad for Dakota Johnson cause she is a good actress but she deserves to have better roles then this. It can be said for the same for the rest of the cast members.The uses of product placements are annoying, action moments are dull, and and all in all, it was boring. Superhero movies shouldn't be boring but this really dragged on. It's unfortunate cause female superhero leads are something I love to see more like Wonder Woman and The Old Guard which are pretty fun. But unfortunately, it seemed that it likely isn't going to happen anytime soon.There really isn't anything else to say.Bad.","1","14 February 2024"
"AlsExGal","... when I saw Dakota Johnson was starring in it. Naturally I can't lay the entirety of this hot mess at her feet. But there is some really bad campy acting happening on her part, reminiscent of the Fifty Shades of Grey movies in which she starred. Perhaps it was because the director was more interested in the placement of Pepsi cans than her performance, but I digress.Basically, this movie plays out like the cut scenes from a budget Xbox 360 game. From the ground up this thing just feels designed to fail. It feels almost Producersesque in its approach in just how every aspect is seemingly intentionally mangled, yet no one seems to care. How have we come so full circle to go through the glory of Infinity War/Logan/The Dark Knight to arrive all the way back to Batman and Robin and Catwoman levels of superhero flicks? (Bam!, Pow!, Gosh yes Batman!)How did this movie make it so far that it has an actual release, and no one stopped it? How did this idea get green lit? Why did Sony give 80 million and turn over their valuable IP to the people that wrote Morbius, Gods of Egypt, Dracula Untold and The Last Witch Hunter? How did this get past the writing process and again have that script greenlit? How could no one on the set at any point stop things? How did no one in the editing room point out how bad it looked and how much of a mess it was?But to the suits it's not about art and story. Instead it's about business, and people are just a commodity. It's cheaper to recycle known quantities, and practice nepotism and involve maybe less than talented friends, people you've worked with before, than go out and find artists with worthy stories. They don't care about art, they don't care about stories, they care about making this work for them financially, regardless of loss of reputation with audiences as a whole.Youtuber Chris Stuckmann did a deep dive on the topic of big studios being generally run by folks who came up through management rather than the creative rungs such as writing and directing when he discussed this film. His take is worth watching. For some reason, Chris doesn't do critical movie reviews since he has become a filmmaker, but I can tell by his tone that, like me, he was completely displeased watching this one. I'd avoid it.","2","17 February 2024"
"eoinageary","This is, well I guess this is a movie in the Sony universe that I'm SHOCKED is profitable.The story is all over the place, it's basically about Madame Web who is a paramedic and develops powers and can see into the future, with a current threat she tries to change the future, teaming up with 3 powerful characters who are yet to develop into their full potential so she must shield them and change the future to protect them.Trying not to give the little story that gets told away in the opening there but i have to be vague.What I liked, one or two good scenes, I didn't mind the end, I really liked a lot of the camera work some cool looking shots and a decent Score.But the movie is BAD, it makes Morbius look like The Batman 2022. The acting is lacking, the actors look as bored as you will feel. Script is bad, just some beyond silly lines, the story chops and changes so much your neck will hurt you, some bad CGI, and just boring action.And before people harp on about ""you don't like it because it's women leads"" no, it's just a crap film, I enjoyed the marvels, Black Widow was decent, so no, the movie regardless of its leads is just poor.Extremely disappointing, 3/10.","3","14 February 2024"
"tbunker-88294","I can honestly say that once again (not that anyone is surprised) that Sony has bombed again with its superhero content. Underwhelming action, bad characters, weird dialogue, generic villain. Its just plain badI feel bad for the cast of this movie, you have EXCELLENT talent and its just wasted in this cash grab excuse of a movieSony has proved once again it can't be trusted with superhero content and has lost what little credibility it had. If the company had any integrity or wits left they should sell their share of ownership back to Marvel and let them assume FULL creative control.I'm not optimistic for Kraven The Hunter after seeing this gross disappointment.","1","14 February 2024"
"hotrobinproductions","Horrible from beginning to end, the opening scene just reeks of awful predictability from story & plot to the core. You know exactly what will happen before it even happens, the script sucks & the dialogue is even worse. There is quite noticeable audio dub edited after the fact too. This budget is 80 million, not that budget matters, because no amount of money could have saved this train wreck, but I mention this because you can still make a good film on lower budgets, Shazam, the first one, had the same budget & delt with a lot of side characters too, it's miles better, Godzilla minus one had a extremely low budget too. But this 80 million dollar film not just effects but production, feels obviously cheap, it almost feels like watching a very long pilot episode to a CW tv show.You thought Morbius was bad, that film was bad because it did the bare minimum, this film doesn't even do the bare minimum, it goes beyond comprehension below that, it just enters a point of no originality or ambition towards creating anything. There isn't even a single superhero moment, even horrible films like catwoman or Morbius has superhero moments & action, this thing doesn't, you get instead visions of the future to potentially set up sequels.This movie also has a serious problem of product placement, it's a long commercial, to be exact a long Pepsi commercial, I feel like Pepsi stopped the halftime show so they could invest in the product placement in this film. This movie was more important to them than the superbowl LOL it's just so over the top & obviously placed way too much in this film. Calvin Klein, Chase bank, the list goes on. This movie should be called superhero product placement the movie.It's barely even close to a 1/10 the cool moments are seeing what we already saw in the trailer when she's seeing the future & you think it's happening now but then it goes back to the moment she realizes it's a vision, granted it's cool the first couple times but it gets old REAL quick. & it ends up getting annoying because it's abused way too much.Thats about it, there isn't any redeeming things in this film, the acting isn't even good. I would say the 3 side character spider women that Dakota finds when they are together there was a potential spark. I saw the talent & potential, but they are failed big time by such a horrid script that the spark never even sparks, it's just like showing you the matches & gasoline & not setting the fire.Madame M0RBIUS / 10.","1","16 February 2024"
"olcare","It's the worst movie and superhero adaptation I've watched in recent years. Completely atrocious effects, atrocious screenplay, and atrocious acting. Also, a big insult to all comic book readers and those who know the original story.Let me describe the movie simply. First of all, I am filled with hatred; I really want to curse the entire creative team for this unacceptable film.All the performances are bad, everyone. There's not a single good actor trying; everyone just took the role for money. It's a terrible disgrace, a total eclipse of reason.The screenplay is the worst superhero screenplay I've ever seen. It barely resembles the original story, and if there aren't scenes like the other Spider-Girls in the trailer, why include them? There's no such obligation; instead, write a decent screenplay. All action scenes are full of logical errors; they've written it without thinking, it's complete garbage.Apart from these, the direction, sorry to say, is garbage too. Most scenes are shot as if they were taken straight from a phone camera; action scenes are not shown, they're hidden due to the atrociousness of the effects. It's shameful.After these general points, Sony urgently needs to cancel this universe; the original stories are garbage, there's no logic, no connection anywhere. They're just being shot randomly. I don't like to curse, but I hope this film sinks at the box office.The last scene with Madame Web gaining her powers, those web effects, clinging to souls, it's unbelievable how you approved this film, may God punish you.I don't know which one to talk about; all the atrocities are collected in this film. Whether it's the woman going to Peru and back in 30 seconds, Spider-Man dodging with fireworks, dancing at the boys' table when my daughters are left alone, not telling the story of the Spider-Human community, or the woman talking normally while giving birth at the end, everything is a disgrace. I hope this universe sinks, and you all get fired. No one involved in the management of this film deserves their job respectfully; they should quit immediately.Note: Dakota Johnson made a statement saying she didn't watch the movie. Why are you serving a completely garbage film if you're not going to watch it? Life shouldn't be all about money for you; we, in our poverty, are trying to watch it, and this is no different from cursing all the audience's families. Shame on you.Note 2: Just now, I looked at the budget of the movie, and my anger grew even more, 80 million dollars EIGHTY MILLION. How can I not believe this money, I really can't believe it, it's nothing but disrespect to yourself, disrespect to the audience, nothing but an insult.","1","16 February 2024"
"sinscopefilms","First Impression:The opening of the Madame Web was immersed in a mystique and ambition, enhanced by great musical score; yet, as the movie progresses, it becomes a mixed bag and a rollercoaster of emotions.The Positive:Musical Score and Sound Design: The standout feature of ""Madame Web"" is its musical score. The soundtrack not only enhances the emotional depth of the film but also succeeds in creating in some moments genuine goosebumps. The sound design really enhances this impact by carefully using sound pans, bass, and reverse effects. It creates a sense of tension and immersion which is one of the film's strongest features.The Mixed:Visual Effects and Costume Design: Some of the visual effects in ""Madame Web"" were visually appealing. The costume design, like Casey's red jacket and the three spider girl villain outfits standing out as particularly stunning contributions to the film's aesthetic, but it was not often shown in the film since the films direction and focus was different. I was disappointed.Acting and Direction: Although I thought Casey's character development - her ability to see the world from a different perspective - was great, I didn't like how it was visually presented. The way it was edited was poorly done. The editor could use 2 distinct color grading features where one sees the future and two, she sees the present moment.However, The performances throughout the film feel lackluster, with the actors appearing confused and disengaged. This, combined with direction that fails to maintain interest or coherence in many scenes, significantly undermines the film's potential.Negatives:Cinematography: Cinematography is bad since some pictures don't show a clear image. The camera moves so fast that I cannot comprehend the picture. I kind of recognized that it tries to initiate the rapidness of the events from the spider's eye point of view but it was a tasteless decision. The Cinematography is not something like wow. The reason why Cinematography was lacking is because it was heavily based on medium closeups and dutch tilts which on one hand was a unique choice but on the other hand very hard to watch. I found the 180 degree round camera rotations super cool, but again, I expected varied distance shots, not just medium shots. The train scene Cinematography was the best in the film.Editing and Pace: The editing is arguably the weakest element of ""Madame Web,"" with its rapid cuts and disjointed flow detracting significantly from the storytelling. This lack of coherence makes it challenging for the audience to fully engage with the narrative.Plot and Overall Execution: The storyline of ""Madame Web"" is cluttered and clichéd, suffering from a lack of originality and clear direction. The film's ambition is evident, but the execution falls short of creating a compelling narrative.The Conclusion:""Madame Web"" presents a paradoxical experience, with exceptional music and sound design standing that sharply contrasts with its various flaws in editing, cinematography, and direction.Although there are some visually and emotionally stunning moments, they are frequently overshadowed by a lack of coherence and clarity.Also, I think this film would be reasonable and great to be incorporated in a TV series which would have allowed for a more in-depth exploration of characters and plot.Nevertheless, Madame Web is a bit of a mixed bag, with moments of potential that ultimately leave the viewer something different visually.Rating: 3/10.","3","15 February 2024"
"Skruffbagg","Cannon, is that you in disguise?I firmly believe Madame Web will go down in history as not only the worst superhero movie, but also one of the worst movies ever made. It's that bad. It's absolutely fascinating to behold.Now, I'll be honest with you here. I only went to see this because I had heard it was an unmitigated disaster that had to be seen to be believed, and it truly does not disappoint - or massively does, depending on your viewpoint.It takes a special kind of director to get such cringe-inducing performances out of a fairly talented cast (Dakota Johnson and Tahar Rahim are both quality actors with the right script and direction), but SJ Clarkson somehow manages to wrangle the absolute worst imaginable from every single person in the film. I'll be very surprised if she ever does another feature after this.Nothing in this film works; the plot is moronic, the script seems like it was written by a teenager, the cinematography is horrendous, the aformentioned embarrassing performances, the audio editing is baffling (so much dubbing, brain-melting music choices). I'm amazed this didn't get shelved the minute the final cut was done.To me, I rate this as ""so bad it's good"" as I wasn't bored watching it, but most people I assume will say it's just plain bad... and it is, but very entertainingly so.If you love watching a 2hr car crash then I highly recommend this. The awfulness is mind-boggling in it's complexity, but in the best possible way. Film scholars and historians will be analysing this movie for years to come, and I hope it is talked about in the same vein as The Room in the future.An absolutely epic misfire on all levels.","1","20 February 2024"
"MiroslavKyuranov","It's astonishing to think that Sony could put out a worse product than 2022's Morbius, but boy, ""Madame Web"" manages it. It is an embarrassing mess. Talented stars wasted on probably one of the worst comic book movie ever (which nobody asked for). Filled with atrocious dialogue, awkward editing and laughable structure. It's a clunky, poorly-written, messy, and sloppy movie packed with some mediocre editing and performances.The concept is interesting on paper, but it couldn't be saved due to it's terrible execution. ""Madame Web"" simply lacked the spark it needed in nearly every dept.There is simply nothing memorable in this movie, except maybe some superhero costumes, but that doesn't redeem the fact that the movie is bad.So yeah...""Madame Web"" is yet another disappointing entry in the Sony's Spider-Less universe. It's like a love letter to an era of superhero films that people largely want to forget. The ""Pepsi"" adds are stand-out, it falls short of what could have been a decent movie in the hands of someone else twenty years ago.","4","14 February 2024"
"darrelltill","There is nothing good in this film. It's badly written - not just full of clichés but full of dialogue that is meant to sound like cliché superhero idioms yet butchered until they make no sense. It is nothing but a costume parade with players that are dead behind the eyes. You can tell that everybody involved knows it's going to be a stinker but they'd already signed on and it was too late. It would be great if this was the flop that made Disney rethink their output (I know, this is actually an SSU movie not an MCU movie, but they are all heading down the same path) but I fear it will take a few more. The solution is really simple - they need to adjust their hiring policy to include persons of talent.","1","15 February 2024"
"movieman6-413-929510","Madame Web is a new spin-off set in the Marvel Spider-Man world. This spin-off is directed, partly written and produced by S. J. Clarkson. Before this film, she directed more TV series episodes of superhero shows such as Jessica Jones and The Defenders.Cassandra Webb (Dakota Johnson) works as a paramedic in New York and learns after an accident that she has superpowers to see future possibilities. She sees that the lives of three girls are threatened by a mysterious masked man with spider-like powers.This is why she tries to protect the three girls and must convince them that their lives are really in danger. To truly protect them, they must ensure that the three listen to her and learn to work together.The story of this film has an interesting concept, but the final story and screenplay were written by five different writers. These writers do not always seem to have been on the same page, because the story sometimes seems a bit rushed or frayed. It sometimes seems as if they didn't really know what exactly to do with it, or what the film studio despised of them. The screenplay has also been rewritten many times, so the cast members could no longer always follow exactly where they were going or supposed to do with the film.Despite these messy, rushed aspects, the film remains on a familiar, predictable side for a superhero film. This can make the film seem a bit long-winded or embarrassing. The film is reminiscent of other superhero films that came out around the year 2000, but of a somewhat lesser quality.The visual effects don't always look believable either. The blue screen and CGI can be seen in the film. For some of the cast members, this was also the first time they had actually worked in a film with such visual effects. The fact that they have little or no experience with these film situations is sometimes reflected in their acting.The poor script also gives the cast members few opportunities to make something special of their roles. Dakota Johnson also seemed a bit uncomfortable during promotions of the film, or ignorant of how to properly promote this film. In the final film she tries to make the best of the role and tries to add some comedy to the role, but she doesn't always get the chance to do this. Sydney Sweeney, Isabela Merced and Celeste O'Connor play the three girls Cassandra tries to protect. All three are given a little time to give their characters some personalities, but unfortunately not enough to make you as a viewer really care about the three. For a better focused film, they might have been better off using a character in the story, who Cassandra then has to protect. Tahar Rahim plays the villain in the film, who tries to kill the three girls, but also deals with the poor, weak script. As a result, he does not emerge as strongly as the villain of the story. They also didn't incorporate his audio work well into the film, because his lips sometimes don't always match what his character is saying.With all these superhero spin-off films from the Sony film studio, they only make Marvel's current film series more messy. If Sony and Disney Marvel try to collaborate on the same film series, they will have to consult each other more and better and plan where they want to go with this film series.","2","17 February 2024"
"ethanbresnett","Based on Madame Web's woeful reviews I was expecting this film to be an utter car crash. To its credit I will say it isn't entirely without merit, but it is incredibly boring and bland.Mostly this is because nothing particularly happens. It's a superhero movie with little to no superhero action and a painfully long set up for an underwhelming final act. The characters are so underdeveloped that there is no emotional connection or investment in any of them. Everything about the story and writing just feels lazy, vacuous and corny.Then there's the villain who is utterly uninspiring. He is constantly complaining about 'everything he has built' being destroyed. What has he built you might ask? The film has no interest in exploring this question. He's easily one of the more two dimensional and weak superhero villains I've ever seen committed to screen.Perhaps the most heinous crime this movie commits is to waste the talents of Dakota Johnson, Sydney Sweeney, Adam Scott, Emma Roberts, Zosia Mamet and more. Such a good cast was assembled and they were given absolutely nothing to work with, so I don't blame the performers. It's just such a shame to see such great talent put to the sword like this.As if all of this wasn't enough, the movie also feels remarkably low budget and feels excruciatingly long despite its relatively short runtime.Ultimately I think this film suffered because it was clearly intended as a set up for a wider Spider-Woman franchise which is unlikely to come to fruition. There seemed to be no interest in making a good stand alone movie, and no respect for the audience. A massive waste of time.","3","21 February 2024"
"vfphvnpp","I understand what the plan was here. They wanted a trippy film, focusing on a strong future for the Sony verse. The problem is the delivery. The camera work in this movie made it quite irritating to follow, as there was constant quick close up shots of the action. The dialogue was awful, and there was quite a lot of blatant voice over during the villain scenes.So much wasted time was given to boring scenes in the movie, which led me to believe the screen writers finished the script and realised that it was under the word count.Honestly the acting quality was quite poor across the board, especially the villain, who honestly seems as if they didn't cast for his role at all, just picked up someone off the side of the road.For someone who's guilty pleasure is watching bad movies, I it was a painful time. Don't recommend.","2","14 February 2024"
"jtorch-11283","Don't waste your time, and money seeing this in theaters. I was fooled by the trailer which looked promising. All the action in the whole film ( a total of 2 scenes) is shown in the the trailer. The rest of the movie is just terrible acting trying to save an even worse scrip.I'm honestly not sure how this made it to the big screen. I'm not a cinema expert, but shouldn't someone have to view the finished product and give the O. K. At some point before it is ""audience ready?"" I feel like that step in the process was skipped. I don't know what Marvel had to do with this film, but it certainly isn't the Iron-Man-Marvel I keep hoping they will somehow revive.And to whom it may concern, ""my parents don't love me."" Is neither a solid backstory OR a strong character trait. I hope you eat a lot of money on this movie.","1","15 February 2024"
"cosby_don","I don't know where to start-actually, I do! THIS IS THE WORST MOVIE IN THE HISTORY OF HUMANITY. I'm not kidding.I'm not sure what other movie this Dakota Johnson has been in, but after watching THIS movie, I'll probably never support her again. This was an absolute career killer. Ms. Johnson, please FIRE your agent immediately.To the production crew, editors, director, and ESPECIALLY the writers (I counted 4 writers-that's RIDICULOUS), shame on you for contributing to this mess. It's obvious you've traded in your morals for a paycheck. That's Hollywood for ya'.Did I mention that this movie was HORRENDOUSLY bad? Everything about this movie was bad-there are ZERO redeeming qualities.The story: STUPID. Worst I've ever seen, seriously. Madam Web ask the girls to wait for 3 hours in the woods? STUPID. The guy partner keeping the girls as Madam Web flies to Peru to check something out. STUPID. Madam a Web getting her powers from a spider bite through her mother. STUPID. I could seriously go on and on. I'm not kidding-EVERYTHING in this movie was STUPID. I can't count how many times I shook my head and said ""This is so bad.""The acting? Very wooden. Ms. Dakota Johnson's acting chops were the worst of the worst here. I really pray that she's done work much better. The other girls-they tried. Jokes fell flat, and they said the DUMBEST lines ever in a movie. I was seriously angry at how dumb they were.The villain? The most generic, uninteresting, uncool villain over ever seen on film. Not one memorable quote. Come to think, did he even make a ""evil guy"" speech? Nope!The ending? Oh my, HORRENDOUS. She's smiling in her glasses while paralyzed in a wheel chair?

"rgkarim","LIKES:The Commentary At Times
-Some lines in this movie are startling at how funny they were for me, a fantastic bout of teenage emotions with a less than thrilled babysitter.-Madame Web's origin story is almost like an anti-hero tale to Charles Xavier idea, and though it's not fully fleshed out, there is emotion, fun, and what felt natural angst and vulnerability into it.-With the right timing, and build up, this section of commentary was a striking positive in this reviewers book.Representation of Paramedics
-It's a rare thing to get to actually see E. M. T's in their work and what they give to serve the public.-While a bit forced, and perhaps a tad overdone and cheesy, kudos for Madame Web accomplishing some detailed shots of them serving the public and giving a little character development with it.-There were great avenues taken to help ingrain parts into the story, and with that, the medical nerd inside me found a cool little nod in those sequences.Some Artistic Visuals Are Cool
-I'm a sucker for a good shot and a good artistic visual popping out and ingraining itself into my mind.-Madame Web has some of these moments for me, the creepy and yet serene world of the Web World, being one that holds majesty and mystery, but also the very emotions of the person trying to wield it.-Other shots of costume crusaders striking that right pose, or perhaps that nostalgic early 2000s look, really help establish some of the themes of the movie or a good set up visual to cascade into.-It may be sprinkled about, but there were some superhero visuals that accomplished the job for me in Madame Web.Talented Cast
-Celeste O'Connor is very fun in this movie. A tad quirky, but she keeps the attitude going, a lot of that sass very fun and usually well-placed to help move the story towards forced comedy and obvious story telling.-Merced eventually grew on me after she got into the meat of her character and starting to push past the stubborn and cheeky attitude. She's got charming charisma, a fun brainy side to exploit, and this sadness that she uses to illicit such emotion, something I wanted more of, but got only little.-Sweeney is fun in this movie. Toned down from the other roles I've seen, the woman knows how to adapt her style and give me something to hook to several times. I love the awkwardness she brings, the tie in to the two extremes, and her surprising smallness after she plays such big roles.-And Johnson is about the same as she always is. A snarky and condescending nature that she wields expertly, but a tad dry at times that some lines feel unfulfilled. Fortunately, she's got good chemistry with the girls that assisted in smoothing out the faults.Some Surprising Character Arcs
-The movie may miss a lot of things, but there are a few moments that work very well to show the potential of Madame Web if given the right focus.-An opening that holds some merit was one of the victories, something that would eventually bleed into plot points further on that gave you a very touching moment.-And another element has the other's origin stories granting us some potential hurt and relatable tales to latch onto and acknowledge. Again, helping give a young and in your face Charlie's Angel group some vim and vigor.The Music
-Call me a sucker for nostalgia, Madame Web has a mix of songs that were perfect for viewers like me to enjoy.-Comedic use of the songs are not the most creative, but add that minor element to help give the girls a little more dynamic and believability.-While other times, it's just a blast of the speakers and me dancing in my seat as the forgotten wonder returns for another run to get things started.DISLIKES:The Pacing Uneven
-Despite the trinkets and some merits to the story, Madame Web's dislikes for me start with the pacing of the tale.-A moderately slow start did little to keep me engaged, only to then have these sprints of faster moments to try to change things up, before hitting the brakes again.-Like a CW season crammed into one, Madame Web's pacing feels a lot like dressed up teenage drama trying to give realism and gradual steps, but really just being the mashup of the uglier time use dramas can get stuck to.The Stale Mechanic
-From the trailers, you know there is some type of vision gimmick that Cassie is supposed to use to protect her charges.-That gimmick gets stale very quickly for a viewer like me, the convoluted presentation starting out fun at first, but then turning into annoying déjà vu that felt more like reshoots than actual artistic twisting.-Like Moon Knight, that element makes sense at first, but really could have stopped halfway through the movie once the viewers has connected the powers.-Had there been a bit more excitement, fighting, or even better storytelling to distract, it would have been less impactful, but alas, for me, all the other limitations added up.Lack of Other Character Development
-There are a lot of characters in this movie, some played by bigger names than the leads themselves. And yet, their time and character development felt shoehorned than planned out.-Adam Scott and Emma Roberts seem disengaged, with stories that are cliché, simplistic, and a waste of talent that again showed potential with that slower pacing at the start.-But even the villain and main girls tales feel very bland, and that lack of character development was very much felt by me that it almost seems to rely heavily on another movie to do these characters justice.Annoying Dialogue
-I know, I said the commentary was good, but that was a small amount of it compared to the whole.-Madame Web's dialogue seems to have gone through the writing grinder several times, very loaded with one liners, sassy comments and attitude that seemed to be out of place for much of the film for me.-Statements of the obvious, corny dialogue essentially pushed in with too simplistic of writing and in your face, overdramatic flair to count as quality dialogue. It needs tuning up, needs to be less forceful, and try to add a little Hollywood magic to help tenderize it to something matching a comic book movie.A Villain Needing A Lot More
-Don't get me wrong, there is an element to him that is relatable, believable, and indeed threatening in terms of the madness of his actions.-But outside of this and the opening scene, Ezekiel is a very bland bad guy who just didn't get the time to shine outside of crawling and repeating the same lines over and over.-The direction failed to give him any recognizable skills, his threats empty most of the time and sort of creepy obsessive, and dare I say his actual character is zoomed over and practically absent but for the opening line.-To me, that's a limited villain and one major flaw that much of the movie suffers from.Visuals Get Really Muddy/Bad
-Sony makes such great looking video games, and yet their movies still suffer from last gen effects
-While the artistic flair of those moments was enjoyable, they did have that faux effect that dropped some of the realism this movie was going for.-Even worse, there are lots of movements, character renderings, and powers that leave a lot to be desired in looking their best. I won't say it's a dealbreaker, but it doesn't help to have such limited technology presentation.Scenes/Story Seem Very Chopped Up
-Between the gimmicks and pacing, the scenes already feel limited, messy, and almost like an abbreviated version of what they could be.-Sure, the dialogue gives you everything they are going for, but the presentation felt very much like a lot of reshoots of the same scene, and slight changes that made little difference.-Such indecisive direction and edits got away from them and left me just wondering what this film could have been with half the gimmicks of the visions pulled back.The Action Is Very Boring
-No denying this, Madame Web maybe even worse than many of the CW attempts at action.-While witty, and an amusing game of cat and mouse, a Spiderverse without a solid one or two fights is a verse I'm not fond playing in for nearly two hours.-A lame villain does little but strut and crawl, while our cast somehow running away and eluding comes off a bit pathetic than entertaining.-Even the climax is a mess, rushed finishes, suspense of disbelief, and an overdramatic battle of words with a very extravagant and mushy ending to cap it off.-Eternals at least had a few moves that had me rocking in my seat, but this... this was a challenge to stay awake in.The VERDICT:
Madame Web is certainly not the worst movie I've seen in years, but that doesn't mean Sony's latest is a masterpiece either. There are elements of this vision that show the potential for a good future, but need a lot of work to make up for this rushed installment. A talented cast, music and some fun writing can be the starting building blocks, but it can't offset what feels like lots of production limitations, rewrites, and editing that greatly show in this movie. Boring battles, annoying gimmicks, and under developed characters despite a strong cast were just some of the limitations this movie has to work through if a series is to come with it. Should one see it in theaters? Not really. A shot at home, I would say sure, but with all of this, my scores for the movie are:Action/Adventure/Sci-Fi: 6.0
Movie Overall: 5.0.","5","15 February 2024"
"eddie_baggins","I'm not ashamed to admit I've seen some movies in my time.I am however ashamed to admit curiosity got the better of me and I ended up in an almost entirely empty cinema screening (thanks to one tolerant movie buddy who joined me on my trip to the local cinema) partaking in what can only be described as one of the most universally panned Hollywood blockbusters of the modern era.Not at all interested in watching another Sony Marvel outing after their last few efforts, hearing about the insanely awesome awfulness of Madame Web from friends, internet identities and esteemed critics made me want to witness a potential all-time cringe-fest and while when people are absolutely right in their hyperbole around just how bad Madame Web is, I'm still trying to comprehend how I could possibly testify to just how bad things are here.Directed by long time TV episode director S. J. Clarkson and featuring a cast of performers who have all proven over time to be more than capable of bringing the goods, Madame Web is not devoid of talent that may have been able to salvage some type of goodness from an offence against the entire cinematic medium but as a finished? (Honestly I am unsure how anyone could claim this is an acceptable final version, just watch for some of the most flawed examples of ADR you're ever going to see) product there was no one or any thing that could've saved this nightmare from the fate it had created for itself.An experience that could only possibly come from a collective group who all gave up the fight to save it long before shooting had wrapped, Madame Web inexcusably comes from the same penmanship that was guilty of unleashing Morbius on us but screenwriters Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless at least managed to find some cult like goodness in Jared Leto and Matt Smith's wildly OTT characters and bizarre action segments but Madame Web is nothing more than two hours of terrible plot, characters, spectacle and intentions and there is quite literally no valid reason for this movie to exist in the form it has been given.One of the most atrociously acted Hollywood films ever captured, with lead Dakota Johnson unable to hold back her disdain for a film she clearly hated being a part of and poor old Tahar Rahim taking the films most unfortunate mantle from a wigged Sydney Sweeney, Madame Web may have been promoted as some type of intense action thriller following the exploits of Johnson's Cassandra Webb as she battles Rahim's Ezekiel Sims alongside Sweeney's Julia, Isabela Merced's Anya and Celeste O'Connor's Mattie but we get something else entirely that is hard to come to terms with.From some of the most detestable and frequent examples of product placement that becomes instantly iconic (some viewers may find themselves attempting to crack open a Pepsi can in their Calvin Klein's after a viewing), a villain we literally know nothing about with zero attempts to bother explaining his plans or background, an embarrassing use of comic staple characters that aren't even put into action outside of dream sequences and a script that must surely have been conjured on ChatGPT, Madame Web is a cesspool of Hollywood excrement that isn't even funny in its horribleness, just merely sad and depressing.The only justifiable reason for Madame Web to be the film it is as it stands is if Sony are deliberately attempting to sabotage their Marvel property that no longer is allowed to include many fan favourites, if they aren't in fact doing that there is zero excuses for why Madame Web has ever been allowed to be birthed into existence.An irredeemable, amateurish and embarrassing exercise in pointless, Madame Web is a shockingly bad example of blockbuster filmmaking that is the exact type of bottom feeder product the cinema industry and the Marvel brand didn't need at this particular point of time.Final Say -If you're a glutton for punishment and want to be reminded of everything you wouldn't wish to see in a supposed piece of big screen entertainment then Madame Web is for you! A truly iconic new addition to the staples of all-time misfires, nothing could prepare one for the garbage that is this $80 million dollar disasterpiece.0 fireworks to the head out of 5.Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)","1","22 February 2024"
"shaikhirshad-41223","Literally I had zero expectations when I went to watch this flick but I still thought that something should be good in this to watch at least one time because of marvel name in it. But this movie is so low and looks like low budget CGI thriller and a comedy in the name of superhero genre.I mean from the start itself movie lost it's pace and story and god only knows what are they showing no interest in the screenplay and the plot is not even engaging to watch for at least 30 mins.I only went for Dakota & Sydney just because the screen presence of them looks good, but the director loss this opportunity too. Because the character they're playing is so bad and not even proper dialogues are given and just they have made a common character with no story arc just the situation that they have to act
I've never seen such a bad cinematography of any film it looks like they don't have any interest making this film so they just made a spoof just to show that we are making a movie. Don't know what to say more because this film is that bad.Overall a Boring fest and a spoof fo a superhero genre.","2","16 February 2024"
"vengeance20","Ok, so before people come at me with the ""YoU dIdN't LiKe It BeCaUsE iT wAs FeMaLe LeAd."" chestnut. I went into this one with an open mind, but expecting it to be as described & the reviews were right. The film is bad.The film sees Cassandra Webb who is a New York metropolis paramedic who begins to demonstrate signs of clairvoyance. Forced to challenge revelations about her past, she needs to safeguard 3 young girls from a deadly adversary who wants them destroyed.I found the film to be pretty bad. It's disjointed, clunky, poorly paced & just feels very awkward & stiff. The characters are personality-less, they look & sound as if they're reciting their lines from cue cards (almost robotic, I might add) & the script reads like a supermarket shopping receipt.The films story is all over the place, confusing & hard to follow. The premonition sequences the main lead experiences were annoying & while creative, were repetitive to the point where you couldn't tell if she was hallucinating or actually seeing what she was seeing.The films runtime is overly long for what it is, while not as bad as other films which are generally over 2 hours (rolls eyes), this film felt longer & as I said was too long for what it was at 1 hour & 48 minutes (108 minutes) without credits & the pacing, jeez... don't get me started.The actors were alright, but what they were given script wise, didn't work & made them come across as flat. There's some action & not bad effects to be had, but that's pretty much the only redeeming features from this flick, sadly. It hasn't a lot going for it & is pretty lack luster & basic.Don't get me wrong, I prefer films with straight forward story-lines & plots you can follow, but this one was a bit too basic & could've used more meatiness to beef it up more as well as more emphasis to keep the audience engaged with the story, characters, action etc.I generally didn't like the film & the ending is just out there too & is pretty cringy like some of the scenes in the film as well as the few cringy action sequences themselves among some of the good action we got.Overall, it's a bad film. And no, it's got nothing to do with the old chestnut of me being a man who doesn't like the film because it's female lead. The film was bad & had plenty of things wrong with it. People in general, men & women, boys & girls, didn't like this flick.The story is bland, boring & paper thin like the characters & leads, the little bit of good action & effects seen are overshadowed by the aforementioned issues as well as the other issues like the poor runtime, pacing & the lacking engagement the film has.Also, for those who can't seem to get it in their heads, there's been plenty of female lead films in the past that have done well, from the Alien Franchise to The Hunger Games along with Elektra, Tomb Raider, Salt, Lucy, Hanna etc. I could go on but that's my rant for those who need calling out.2/10.","2","20 February 2024"
"izadyardariush","I could tell from the beginning, making this movie was a bad idea. After I saw the cast I could tell this movie doomed. I have nothing against any of those actors but I must say casting a Dakota was a biggest mistake for the role! Anyone read the comics could say that. This movie was like terminator meeting final destination! No good story, big mess, lot of waste of potentials. I must say worst choice of villain!

"alindsayal","With Marvel Studios taking on more responsibility involving Spider-Man, Sony have decided to try and build a universe involving smaller characters from the same lore as him. We have had Venom and Morbius and will get Kraven The Hunter later this year but here we have Madame Web. I saw this film last night and here is my review for Madame Web. The p[remise of the film sees a women bestowed with powers where she has to save 3 girls from being killed by a villainous foe.Main Character
I must be honest that I have never been a huge fan of Dakota Johnson and she plays Cassandra Web here and I have to be honest she isn't particularly good here. She is overacting everything here and her character is super unlikeable and hard to care about. She is clearly hampered by the awful writing in this film and she can't rise above it and give us a lead role to support or care about and Cassie Web will go down as one of the worst leads in a comic book film ever.Supporting Characters
Sydney Sweeney, Isabela Merced & Celeste O'Connor play the three girls that are in the view of the villain and they are all pretty awful. Their characters are really awkward and not particularly likeable, the film tries to force you to like and care about these characters but it comes across poorly and these actresses aren't good enough to make me care.Tahar Rahim plays Ezekiel Sims and he is one of the more frustrating parts of this film because I have seen him be a good actor and this character had some potential but the film really flops here and makes him this over the top villain that is so stupid that it really takes you out of the film.Adam Scott as Ben Parker is probably the best person here but he isn't really given much to do and it still upsets me that he plays Ben Parker and it is really clear that this was just done to provide some stupid fan service that actually annoys me even more.Story
The story is nonsensical and completely stupid. The plot makes no sense and characters do things that make no sense, Cassie Web in particular is one of the dumbest characters that I have seen in recent movies. This film also tries its best to ruin the character of Spider-Man even though he isn't in the film and it is just the backdrop to this pretty dull and horrendous adventure.Script
This is a really awfully written film. Things make no sense, characters are unlikeable and there is no humour here at all. There are so many plot holes it is crazy and the film has nothing interesting about it at all.Style
I mean I guess the action scenes are okay and the bad guys suit was okay but that is it. The film is filmed really poorly, the editing looks unfinished and at times it is actually quite jarring to watch it. There are way too many jump scares especially for a film that is not a horror film. The trailer shows things that barely happen in the film and it feels like we were sold a different film that never got made.Overall
Overall, Madame Web is a truly disastrous film. This is up there with one of the worst films I have ever seen and is up there with the worst comic book films of all time. Though I am glad I saw this film to have this experience but at all cost avoid this garbage and do something better for 2 hours.Rating - 1/10.","1","16 February 2024"
"daisukereds","A baby-sitting movie in a Superhero setting, where the lead can see the future and has to prevent NOT-Spiderman from killing teenagers (because he has dreams/visions about them). The girls run and hide around a lot, some BS happens and then the movie ends.The foundation of the script is heavily written around a hollow core of ""parents and children"". The cinematography is actually good, and at least ""teaches"" how to do CPR. It also does away with showing premonitions every time something is to be changed near the end.. respecting the viewers intelligence in at least that aspect! And it's easy to follow (if you don't fall asleep) with how simplistic it is.Aside from that, it is barely anything else..
The movie itself isn't terrible.. it's just beyond bland and boring. Also, calling this a Superhero movie is really disingenuous and a marketing ploy to get people to see it. Stay home! There are no good action sequences and nobody is written memorably....
Venom making money was a mistake. Sony has half a franchise, and they can't get anyone talented enough to do something with it. And what they continue to release seems like high-budgeted fan fiction!","3","16 February 2024"
"isaacsundaralingam","Yea, this was garbage and that's saying plenty. It's actually adorable how little anyone cared about ""Madame Web"" - not just the audience, but the filmmakers and actors themselves. Written by the same people who wrote ""Morbius"", this movie is yet another reason to not let them anywhere near a writing software ever again.Not only was the movie unwatchable due to how lifeless it was, but it was also criminally boring. You're waiting for something to happen and you keep waiting right until the credits start to roll. Nothing about the movie was compelling, the plot was riddled with plot holes, the screenplay was lazy, the dialogues were dead and the acting was almost as if the actors were held captive and being forced to act as if everything was okay. It reeks of corporate greed and there isn't a single positive thing to say about this movie.We're only a month and half into the year and we already have a very strong contender for what might be the worst movie of the year, and it's not even close. Don't watch it, but if you do indeed decide to, I hope you lived a life well enough to have a crowded funeral.","1","19 February 2024"
"syntory","Look at the profiles for the writers that wrote Madame Web. You'll see virtually every movie they've written has a bad rating and bad reviews. Why then does Hollywood continually hire these same writers for these big budget films? I could understand if they wrote movies for Asylum Films because all their movies are terrible.Madame Web is god awful! Very difficult to sit through. None of the main characters are likeable. Even the villain is lame. It seems like the entire movie was written to set up a sequel. But why would people spend money to see the sequel of a movie that is one of the worst movies ever written? I'm shocked at how bad this movie is and if there is a sequel I certainly wont bother watching it.Stop hiring bad writers, Hollywood!","2","15 February 2024"
"MovieWarfare","I would absolutely love to be in these Sony meetings because I am absolutely baffled how things like Madame Web are getting greenlit.Madame Web is one of the worst superhero movies ever made! It has terrible writing, characters, action setpieces and even acting. Dakota Johnson is so dull and boring as the main lead but this is probably down to the terrible script.To be fair, the movie does have an interesting concept with this Final Destination x Terminator thing. However, it is so poorly executed that it makes Morbius look like The Dark Knight.Anyway give me the ""He Was in the Amazon With My Mom When She Was Researching Spiders Right Before She Died"" cut!","1","17 February 2024"
"chenp-54708","Literally one of the worst superhero movies I have ever seen.From the advertisements, I knew this movie wasn't going to be great but still, it surprised me how bad and boring it was. Everything about the direction, writing, characters, technical aspects, and designs are really awful. The writing is poor as there are many concepts, ideas and aspects that are messy and bland. The messy script creates poor dialogue from the cast and the characters are not interesting. The special effects looked even worse than the marketing and all of the performances were pretty bad. I honestly do feel bad for Dakota Johnson cause she is a good actress but she deserves to have better roles then this. It can be said for the same for the rest of the cast members.The uses of product placements are annoying, action moments are dull, and and all in all, it was boring. Superhero movies shouldn't be boring but this really dragged on. It's unfortunate cause female superhero leads are something I love to see more like Wonder Woman and The Old Guard which are pretty fun. But unfortunately, it seemed that it likely isn't going to happen anytime soon.There really isn't anything else to say.Bad.","1","14 February 2024"
"AlsExGal","... when I saw Dakota Johnson was starring in it. Naturally I can't lay the entirety of this hot mess at her feet. But there is some really bad campy acting happening on her part, reminiscent of the Fifty Shades of Grey movies in which she starred. Perhaps it was because the director was more interested in the placement of Pepsi cans than her performance, but I digress.Basically, this movie plays out like the cut scenes from a budget Xbox 360 game. From the ground up this thing just feels designed to fail. It feels almost Producersesque in its approach in just how every aspect is seemingly intentionally mangled, yet no one seems to care. How have we come so full circle to go through the glory of Infinity War/Logan/The Dark Knight to arrive all the way back to Batman and Robin and Catwoman levels of superhero flicks? (Bam!, Pow!, Gosh yes Batman!)How did this movie make it so far that it has an actual release, and no one stopped it? How did this idea get green lit? Why did Sony give 80 million and turn over their valuable IP to the people that wrote Morbius, Gods of Egypt, Dracula Untold and The Last Witch Hunter? How did this get past the writing process and again have that script greenlit? How could no one on the set at any point stop things? How did no one in the editing room point out how bad it looked and how much of a mess it was?But to the suits it's not about art and story. Instead it's about business, and people are just a commodity. It's cheaper to recycle known quantities, and practice nepotism and involve maybe less than talented friends, people you've worked with before, than go out and find artists with worthy stories. They don't care about art, they don't care about stories, they care about making this work for them financially, regardless of loss of reputation with audiences as a whole.Youtuber Chris Stuckmann did a deep dive on the topic of big studios being generally run by folks who came up through management rather than the creative rungs such as writing and directing when he discussed this film. His take is worth watching. For some reason, Chris doesn't do critical movie reviews since he has become a filmmaker, but I can tell by his tone that, like me, he was completely displeased watching this one. I'd avoid it.","2","17 February 2024"
"eoinageary","This is, well I guess this is a movie in the Sony universe that I'm SHOCKED is profitable.The story is all over the place, it's basically about Madame Web who is a paramedic and develops powers and can see into the future, with a current threat she tries to change the future, teaming up with 3 powerful characters who are yet to develop into their full potential so she must shield them and change the future to protect them.Trying not to give the little story that gets told away in the opening there but i have to be vague.What I liked, one or two good scenes, I didn't mind the end, I really liked a lot of the camera work some cool looking shots and a decent Score.But the movie is BAD, it makes Morbius look like The Batman 2022. The acting is lacking, the actors look as bored as you will feel. Script is bad, just some beyond silly lines, the story chops and changes so much your neck will hurt you, some bad CGI, and just boring action.And before people harp on about ""you don't like it because it's women leads"" no, it's just a crap film, I enjoyed the marvels, Black Widow was decent, so no, the movie regardless of its leads is just poor.Extremely disappointing, 3/10.","3","14 February 2024"

"hotrobinproductions","Horrible from beginning to end, the opening scene just reeks of awful predictability from story & plot to the core. You know exactly what will happen before it even happens, the script sucks & the dialogue is even worse. There is quite noticeable audio dub edited after the fact too. This budget is 80 million, not that budget matters, because no amount of money could have saved this train wreck, but I mention this because you can still make a good film on lower budgets, Shazam, the first one, had the same budget & delt with a lot of side characters too, it's miles better, Godzilla minus one had a extremely low budget too. But this 80 million dollar film not just effects but production, feels obviously cheap, it almost feels like watching a very long pilot episode to a CW tv show.You thought Morbius was bad, that film was bad because it did the bare minimum, this film doesn't even do the bare minimum, it goes beyond comprehension below that, it just enters a point of no originality or ambition towards creating anything. There isn't even a single superhero moment, even horrible films like catwoman or Morbius has superhero moments & action, this thing doesn't, you get instead visions of the future to potentially set up sequels.This movie also has a serious problem of product placement, it's a long commercial, to be exact a long Pepsi commercial, I feel like Pepsi stopped the halftime show so they could invest in the product placement in this film. This movie was more important to them than the superbowl LOL it's just so over the top & obviously placed way too much in this film. Calvin Klein, Chase bank, the list goes on. This movie should be called superhero product placement the movie.It's barely even close to a 1/10 the cool moments are seeing what we already saw in the trailer when she's seeing the future & you think it's happening now but then it goes back to the moment she realizes it's a vision, granted it's cool the first couple times but it gets old REAL quick. & it ends up getting annoying because it's abused way too much.Thats about it, there isn't any redeeming things in this film, the acting isn't even good. I would say the 3 side character spider women that Dakota finds when they are together there was a potential spark. I saw the talent & potential, but they are failed big time by such a horrid script that the spark never even sparks, it's just like showing you the matches & gasoline & not setting the fire.Madame M0RBIUS / 10.","1","16 February 2024"
"olcare","It's the worst movie and superhero adaptation I've watched in recent years. Completely atrocious effects, atrocious screenplay, and atrocious acting. Also, a big insult to all comic book readers and those who know the original story.Let me describe the movie simply. First of all, I am filled with hatred; I really want to curse the entire creative team for this unacceptable film.All the performances are bad, everyone. There's not a single good actor trying; everyone just took the role for money. It's a terrible disgrace, a total eclipse of reason.The screenplay is the worst superhero screenplay I've ever seen. It barely resembles the original story, and if there aren't scenes like the other Spider-Girls in the trailer, why include them? There's no such obligation; instead, write a decent screenplay. All action scenes are full of logical errors; they've written it without thinking, it's complete garbage.Apart from these, the direction, sorry to say, is garbage too. Most scenes are shot as if they were taken straight from a phone camera; action scenes are not shown, they're hidden due to the atrociousness of the effects. It's shameful.After these general points, Sony urgently needs to cancel this universe; the original stories are garbage, there's no logic, no connection anywhere. They're just being shot randomly. I don't like to curse, but I hope this film sinks at the box office.The last scene with Madame Web gaining her powers, those web effects, clinging to souls, it's unbelievable how you approved this film, may God punish you.I don't know which one to talk about; all the atrocities are collected in this film. Whether it's the woman going to Peru and back in 30 seconds, Spider-Man dodging with fireworks, dancing at the boys' table when my daughters are left alone, not telling the story of the Spider-Human community, or the woman talking normally while giving birth at the end, everything is a disgrace. I hope this universe sinks, and you all get fired. No one involved in the management of this film deserves their job respectfully; they should quit immediately.Note: Dakota Johnson made a statement saying she didn't watch the movie. Why are you serving a completely garbage film if you're not going to watch it? Life shouldn't be all about money for you; we, in our poverty, are trying to watch it, and this is no different from cursing all the audience's families. Shame on you.Note 2: Just now, I looked at the budget of the movie, and my anger grew even more, 80 million dollars EIGHTY MILLION. How can I not believe this money, I really can't believe it, it's nothing but disrespect to yourself, disrespect to the audience, nothing but an insult.","1","16 February 2024"
"sinscopefilms","First Impression:The opening of the Madame Web was immersed in a mystique and ambition, enhanced by great musical score; yet, as the movie progresses, it becomes a mixed bag and a rollercoaster of emotions.The Positive:Musical Score and Sound Design: The standout feature of ""Madame Web"" is its musical score. The soundtrack not only enhances the emotional depth of the film but also succeeds in creating in some moments genuine goosebumps. The sound design really enhances this impact by carefully using sound pans, bass, and reverse effects. It creates a sense of tension and immersion which is one of the film's strongest features.The Mixed:Visual Effects and Costume Design: Some of the visual effects in ""Madame Web"" were visually appealing. The costume design, like Casey's red jacket and the three spider girl villain outfits standing out as particularly stunning contributions to the film's aesthetic, but it was not often shown in the film since the films direction and focus was different. I was disappointed.Acting and Direction: Although I thought Casey's character development - her ability to see the world from a different perspective - was great, I didn't like how it was visually presented. The way it was edited was poorly done. The editor could use 2 distinct color grading features where one sees the future and two, she sees the present moment.However, The performances throughout the film feel lackluster, with the actors appearing confused and disengaged. This, combined with direction that fails to maintain interest or coherence in many scenes, significantly undermines the film's potential.Negatives:Cinematography: Cinematography is bad since some pictures don't show a clear image. The camera moves so fast that I cannot comprehend the picture. I kind of recognized that it tries to initiate the rapidness of the events from the spider's eye point of view but it was a tasteless decision. The Cinematography is not something like wow. The reason why Cinematography was lacking is because it was heavily based on medium closeups and dutch tilts which on one hand was a unique choice but on the other hand very hard to watch. I found the 180 degree round camera rotations super cool, but again, I expected varied distance shots, not just medium shots. The train scene Cinematography was the best in the film.Editing and Pace: The editing is arguably the weakest element of ""Madame Web,"" with its rapid cuts and disjointed flow detracting significantly from the storytelling. This lack of coherence makes it challenging for the audience to fully engage with the narrative.Plot and Overall Execution: The storyline of ""Madame Web"" is cluttered and clichéd, suffering from a lack of originality and clear direction. The film's ambition is evident, but the execution falls short of creating a compelling narrative.The Conclusion:""Madame Web"" presents a paradoxical experience, with exceptional music and sound design standing that sharply contrasts with its various flaws in editing, cinematography, and direction.Although there are some visually and emotionally stunning moments, they are frequently overshadowed by a lack of coherence and clarity.Also, I think this film would be reasonable and great to be incorporated in a TV series which would have allowed for a more in-depth exploration of characters and plot.Nevertheless, Madame Web is a bit of a mixed bag, with moments of potential that ultimately leave the viewer something different visually.Rating: 3/10.","3","15 February 2024"
"Skruffbagg","Cannon, is that you in disguise?I firmly believe Madame Web will go down in history as not only the worst superhero movie, but also one of the worst movies ever made. It's that bad. It's absolutely fascinating to behold.Now, I'll be honest with you here. I only went to see this because I had heard it was an unmitigated disaster that had to be seen to be believed, and it truly does not disappoint - or massively does, depending on your viewpoint.It takes a special kind of director to get such cringe-inducing performances out of a fairly talented cast (Dakota Johnson and Tahar Rahim are both quality actors with the right script and direction), but SJ Clarkson somehow manages to wrangle the absolute worst imaginable from every single person in the film. I'll be very surprised if she ever does another feature after this.Nothing in this film works; the plot is moronic, the script seems like it was written by a teenager, the cinematography is horrendous, the aformentioned embarrassing performances, the audio editing is baffling (so much dubbing, brain-melting music choices). I'm amazed this didn't get shelved the minute the final cut was done.To me, I rate this as ""so bad it's good"" as I wasn't bored watching it, but most people I assume will say it's just plain bad... and it is, but very entertainingly so.If you love watching a 2hr car crash then I highly recommend this. The awfulness is mind-boggling in it's complexity, but in the best possible way. Film scholars and historians will be analysing this movie for years to come, and I hope it is talked about in the same vein as The Room in the future.An absolutely epic misfire on all levels.","1","20 February 2024"
"MiroslavKyuranov","It's astonishing to think that Sony could put out a worse product than 2022's Morbius, but boy, ""Madame Web"" manages it. It is an embarrassing mess. Talented stars wasted on probably one of the worst comic book movie ever (which nobody asked for). Filled with atrocious dialogue, awkward editing and laughable structure. It's a clunky, poorly-written, messy, and sloppy movie packed with some mediocre editing and performances.The concept is interesting on paper, but it couldn't be saved due to it's terrible execution. ""Madame Web"" simply lacked the spark it needed in nearly every dept.There is simply nothing memorable in this movie, except maybe some superhero costumes, but that doesn't redeem the fact that the movie is bad.So yeah...""Madame Web"" is yet another disappointing entry in the Sony's Spider-Less universe. It's like a love letter to an era of superhero films that people largely want to forget. The ""Pepsi"" adds are stand-out, it falls short of what could have been a decent movie in the hands of someone else twenty years ago.","4","14 February 2024"
"darrelltill","There is nothing good in this film. It's badly written - not just full of clichés but full of dialogue that is meant to sound like cliché superhero idioms yet butchered until they make no sense. It is nothing but a costume parade with players that are dead behind the eyes. You can tell that everybody involved knows it's going to be a stinker but they'd already signed on and it was too late. It would be great if this was the flop that made Disney rethink their output (I know, this is actually an SSU movie not an MCU movie, but they are all heading down the same path) but I fear it will take a few more. The solution is really simple - they need to adjust their hiring policy to include persons of talent.","1","15 February 2024"
"movieman6-413-929510","Madame Web is a new spin-off set in the Marvel Spider-Man world. This spin-off is directed, partly written and produced by S. J. Clarkson. Before this film, she directed more TV series episodes of superhero shows such as Jessica Jones and The Defenders.Cassandra Webb (Dakota Johnson) works as a paramedic in New York and learns after an accident that she has superpowers to see future possibilities. She sees that the lives of three girls are threatened by a mysterious masked man with spider-like powers.This is why she tries to protect the three girls and must convince them that their lives are really in danger. To truly protect them, they must ensure that the three listen to her and learn to work together.The story of this film has an interesting concept, but the final story and screenplay were written by five different writers. These writers do not always seem to have been on the same page, because the story sometimes seems a bit rushed or frayed. It sometimes seems as if they didn't really know what exactly to do with it, or what the film studio despised of them. The screenplay has also been rewritten many times, so the cast members could no longer always follow exactly where they were going or supposed to do with the film.Despite these messy, rushed aspects, the film remains on a familiar, predictable side for a superhero film. This can make the film seem a bit long-winded or embarrassing. The film is reminiscent of other superhero films that came out around the year 2000, but of a somewhat lesser quality.The visual effects don't always look believable either. The blue screen and CGI can be seen in the film. For some of the cast members, this was also the first time they had actually worked in a film with such visual effects. The fact that they have little or no experience with these film situations is sometimes reflected in their acting.The poor script also gives the cast members few opportunities to make something special of their roles. Dakota Johnson also seemed a bit uncomfortable during promotions of the film, or ignorant of how to properly promote this film. In the final film she tries to make the best of the role and tries to add some comedy to the role, but she doesn't always get the chance to do this. Sydney Sweeney, Isabela Merced and Celeste O'Connor play the three girls Cassandra tries to protect. All three are given a little time to give their characters some personalities, but unfortunately not enough to make you as a viewer really care about the three. For a better focused film, they might have been better off using a character in the story, who Cassandra then has to protect. Tahar Rahim plays the villain in the film, who tries to kill the three girls, but also deals with the poor, weak script. As a result, he does not emerge as strongly as the villain of the story. They also didn't incorporate his audio work well into the film, because his lips sometimes don't always match what his character is saying.With all these superhero spin-off films from the Sony film studio, they only make Marvel's current film series more messy. If Sony and Disney Marvel try to collaborate on the same film series, they will have to consult each other more and better and plan where they want to go with this film series.","2","17 February 2024"
"ethanbresnett","Based on Madame Web's woeful reviews I was expecting this film to be an utter car crash. To its credit I will say it isn't entirely without merit, but it is incredibly boring and bland.Mostly this is because nothing particularly happens. It's a superhero movie with little to no superhero action and a painfully long set up for an underwhelming final act. The characters are so underdeveloped that there is no emotional connection or investment in any of them. Everything about the story and writing just feels lazy, vacuous and corny.Then there's the villain who is utterly uninspiring. He is constantly complaining about 'everything he has built' being destroyed. What has he built you might ask? The film has no interest in exploring this question. He's easily one of the more two dimensional and weak superhero villains I've ever seen committed to screen.Perhaps the most heinous crime this movie commits is to waste the talents of Dakota Johnson, Sydney Sweeney, Adam Scott, Emma Roberts, Zosia Mamet and more. Such a good cast was assembled and they were given absolutely nothing to work with, so I don't blame the performers. It's just such a shame to see such great talent put to the sword like this.As if all of this wasn't enough, the movie also feels remarkably low budget and feels excruciatingly long despite its relatively short runtime.Ultimately I think this film suffered because it was clearly intended as a set up for a wider Spider-Woman franchise which is unlikely to come to fruition. There seemed to be no interest in making a good stand alone movie, and no respect for the audience. A massive waste of time.","3","21 February 2024"
"vfphvnpp","I understand what the plan was here. They wanted a trippy film, focusing on a strong future for the Sony verse. The problem is the delivery. The camera work in this movie made it quite irritating to follow, as there was constant quick close up shots of the action. The dialogue was awful, and there was quite a lot of blatant voice over during the villain scenes.So much wasted time was given to boring scenes in the movie, which led me to believe the screen writers finished the script and realised that it was under the word count.Honestly the acting quality was quite poor across the board, especially the villain, who honestly seems as if they didn't cast for his role at all, just picked up someone off the side of the road.For someone who's guilty pleasure is watching bad movies, I it was a painful time. Don't recommend.","2","14 February 2024"
"jtorch-11283","Don't waste your time, and money seeing this in theaters. I was fooled by the trailer which looked promising. All the action in the whole film ( a total of 2 scenes) is shown in the the trailer. The rest of the movie is just terrible acting trying to save an even worse scrip.I'm honestly not sure how this made it to the big screen. I'm not a cinema expert, but shouldn't someone have to view the finished product and give the O. K. At some point before it is ""audience ready?"" I feel like that step in the process was skipped. I don't know what Marvel had to do with this film, but it certainly isn't the Iron-Man-Marvel I keep hoping they will somehow revive.And to whom it may concern, ""my parents don't love me."" Is neither a solid backstory OR a strong character trait. I hope you eat a lot of money on this movie.","1","15 February 2024"
"cosby_don","I don't know where to start-actually, I do! THIS IS THE WORST MOVIE IN THE HISTORY OF HUMANITY. I'm not kidding.I'm not sure what other movie this Dakota Johnson has been in, but after watching THIS movie, I'll probably never support her again. This was an absolute career killer. Ms. Johnson, please FIRE your agent immediately.To the production crew, editors, director, and ESPECIALLY the writers (I counted 4 writers-that's RIDICULOUS), shame on you for contributing to this mess. It's obvious you've traded in your morals for a paycheck. That's Hollywood for ya'.Did I mention that this movie was HORRENDOUSLY bad? Everything about this movie was bad-there are ZERO redeeming qualities.The story: STUPID. Worst I've ever seen, seriously. Madam Web ask the girls to wait for 3 hours in the woods? STUPID. The guy partner keeping the girls as Madam Web flies to Peru to check something out. STUPID. Madam a Web getting her powers from a spider bite through her mother. STUPID. I could seriously go on and on. I'm not kidding-EVERYTHING in this movie was STUPID. I can't count how many times I shook my head and said ""This is so bad.""The acting? Very wooden. Ms. Dakota Johnson's acting chops were the worst of the worst here. I really pray that she's done work much better. The other girls-they tried. Jokes fell flat, and they said the DUMBEST lines ever in a movie. I was seriously angry at how dumb they were.The villain? The most generic, uninteresting, uncool villain over ever seen on film. Not one memorable quote. Come to think, did he even make a ""evil guy"" speech? Nope!The ending? Oh my, HORRENDOUS. She's smiling in her glasses while paralyzed in a wheel chair? MAN WHI WROTE THIS MESS??The girls weren't even in costume more than 2 minutes of the entire film, even though in the trailer we came to expect them to be crime fighters and kicking butt in the film.

"rgkarim","LIKES:The Commentary At Times
-Some lines in this movie are startling at how funny they were for me, a fantastic bout of teenage emotions with a less than thrilled babysitter.-Madame Web's origin story is almost like an anti-hero tale to Charles Xavier idea, and though it's not fully fleshed out, there is emotion, fun, and what felt natural angst and vulnerability into it.-With the right timing, and build up, this section of commentary was a striking positive in this reviewers book.Representation of Paramedics
-It's a rare thing to get to actually see E. M. T's in their work and what they give to serve the public.-While a bit forced, and perhaps a tad overdone and cheesy, kudos for Madame Web accomplishing some detailed shots of them serving the public and giving a little character development with it.-There were great avenues taken to help ingrain parts into the story, and with that, the medical nerd inside me found a cool little nod in those sequences.Some Artistic Visuals Are Cool
-I'm a sucker for a good shot and a good artistic visual popping out and ingraining itself into my mind.-Madame Web has some of these moments for me, the creepy and yet serene world of the Web World, being one that holds majesty and mystery, but also the very emotions of the person trying to wield it.-Other shots of costume crusaders striking that right pose, or perhaps that nostalgic early 2000s look, really help establish some of the themes of the movie or a good set up visual to cascade into.-It may be sprinkled about, but there were some superhero visuals that accomplished the job for me in Madame Web.Talented Cast
-Celeste O'Connor is very fun in this movie. A tad quirky, but she keeps the attitude going, a lot of that sass very fun and usually well-placed to help move the story towards forced comedy and obvious story telling.-Merced eventually grew on me after she got into the meat of her character and starting to push past the stubborn and cheeky attitude. She's got charming charisma, a fun brainy side to exploit, and this sadness that she uses to illicit such emotion, something I wanted more of, but got only little.-Sweeney is fun in this movie. Toned down from the other roles I've seen, the woman knows how to adapt her style and give me something to hook to several times. I love the awkwardness she brings, the tie in to the two extremes, and her surprising smallness after she plays such big roles.-And Johnson is about the same as she always is. A snarky and condescending nature that she wields expertly, but a tad dry at times that some lines feel unfulfilled. Fortunately, she's got good chemistry with the girls that assisted in smoothing out the faults.Some Surprising Character Arcs
-The movie may miss a lot of things, but there are a few moments that work very well to show the potential of Madame Web if given the right focus.-An opening that holds some merit was one of the victories, something that would eventually bleed into plot points further on that gave you a very touching moment.-And another element has the other's origin stories granting us some potential hurt and relatable tales to latch onto and acknowledge. Again, helping give a young and in your face Charlie's Angel group some vim and vigor.The Music
-Call me a sucker for nostalgia, Madame Web has a mix of songs that were perfect for viewers like me to enjoy.-Comedic use of the songs are not the most creative, but add that minor element to help give the girls a little more dynamic and believability.-While other times, it's just a blast of the speakers and me dancing in my seat as the forgotten wonder returns for another run to get things started.DISLIKES:The Pacing Uneven
-Despite the trinkets and some merits to the story, Madame Web's dislikes for me start with the pacing of the tale.-A moderately slow start did little to keep me engaged, only to then have these sprints of faster moments to try to change things up, before hitting the brakes again.-Like a CW season crammed into one, Madame Web's pacing feels a lot like dressed up teenage drama trying to give realism and gradual steps, but really just being the mashup of the uglier time use dramas can get stuck to.The Stale Mechanic
-From the trailers, you know there is some type of vision gimmick that Cassie is supposed to use to protect her charges.-That gimmick gets stale very quickly for a viewer like me, the convoluted presentation starting out fun at first, but then turning into annoying déjà vu that felt more like reshoots than actual artistic twisting.-Like Moon Knight, that element makes sense at first, but really could have stopped halfway through the movie once the viewers has connected the powers.-Had there been a bit more excitement, fighting, or even better storytelling to distract, it would have been less impactful, but alas, for me, all the other limitations added up.Lack of Other Character Development
-There are a lot of characters in this movie, some played by bigger names than the leads themselves. And yet, their time and character development felt shoehorned than planned out.-Adam Scott and Emma Roberts seem disengaged, with stories that are cliché, simplistic, and a waste of talent that again showed potential with that slower pacing at the start.-But even the villain and main girls tales feel very bland, and that lack of character development was very much felt by me that it almost seems to rely heavily on another movie to do these characters justice.Annoying Dialogue
-I know, I said the commentary was good, but that was a small amount of it compared to the whole.-Madame Web's dialogue seems to have gone through the writing grinder several times, very loaded with one liners, sassy comments and attitude that seemed to be out of place for much of the film for me.-Statements of the obvious, corny dialogue essentially pushed in with too simplistic of writing and in your face, overdramatic flair to count as quality dialogue. It needs tuning up, needs to be less forceful, and try to add a little Hollywood magic to help tenderize it to something matching a comic book movie.A Villain Needing A Lot More
-Don't get me wrong, there is an element to him that is relatable, believable, and indeed threatening in terms of the madness of his actions.-But outside of this and the opening scene, Ezekiel is a very bland bad guy who just didn't get the time to shine outside of crawling and repeating the same lines over and over.-The direction failed to give him any recognizable skills, his threats empty most of the time and sort of creepy obsessive, and dare I say his actual character is zoomed over and practically absent but for the opening line.-To me, that's a limited villain and one major flaw that much of the movie suffers from.Visuals Get Really Muddy/Bad
-Sony makes such great looking video games, and yet their movies still suffer from last gen effects
-While the artistic flair of those moments was enjoyable, they did have that faux effect that dropped some of the realism this movie was going for.-Even worse, there are lots of movements, character renderings, and powers that leave a lot to be desired in looking their best. I won't say it's a dealbreaker, but it doesn't help to have such limited technology presentation.Scenes/Story Seem Very Chopped Up
-Between the gimmicks and pacing, the scenes already feel limited, messy, and almost like an abbreviated version of what they could be.-Sure, the dialogue gives you everything they are going for, but the presentation felt very much like a lot of reshoots of the same scene, and slight changes that made little difference.-Such indecisive direction and edits got away from them and left me just wondering what this film could have been with half the gimmicks of the visions pulled back.The Action Is Very Boring
-No denying this, Madame Web maybe even worse than many of the CW attempts at action.-While witty, and an amusing game of cat and mouse, a Spiderverse without a solid one or two fights is a verse I'm not fond playing in for nearly two hours.-A lame villain does little but strut and crawl, while our cast somehow running away and eluding comes off a bit pathetic than entertaining.-Even the climax is a mess, rushed finishes, suspense of disbelief, and an overdramatic battle of words with a very extravagant and mushy ending to cap it off.-Eternals at least had a few moves that had me rocking in my seat, but this... this was a challenge to stay awake in.The VERDICT:
Madame Web is certainly not the worst movie I've seen in years, but that doesn't mean Sony's latest is a masterpiece either. There are elements of this vision that show the potential for a good future, but need a lot of work to make up for this rushed installment. A talented cast, music and some fun writing can be the starting building blocks, but it can't offset what feels like lots of production limitations, rewrites, and editing that greatly show in this movie. Boring battles, annoying gimmicks, and under developed characters despite a strong cast were just some of the limitations this movie has to work through if a series is to come with it. Should one see it in theaters? Not really. A shot at home, I would say sure, but with all of this, my scores for the movie are:Action/Adventure/Sci-Fi: 6.0
Movie Overall: 5.0.","5","15 February 2024"
"eddie_baggins","I'm not ashamed to admit I've seen some movies in my time.I am however ashamed to admit curiosity got the better of me and I ended up in an almost entirely empty cinema screening (thanks to one tolerant movie buddy who joined me on my trip to the local cinema) partaking in what can only be described as one of the most universally panned Hollywood blockbusters of the modern era.Not at all interested in watching another Sony Marvel outing after their last few efforts, hearing about the insanely awesome awfulness of Madame Web from friends, internet identities and esteemed critics made me want to witness a potential all-time cringe-fest and while when people are absolutely right in their hyperbole around just how bad Madame Web is, I'm still trying to comprehend how I could possibly testify to just how bad things are here.Directed by long time TV episode director S. J. Clarkson and featuring a cast of performers who have all proven over time to be more than capable of bringing the goods, Madame Web is not devoid of talent that may have been able to salvage some type of goodness from an offence against the entire cinematic medium but as a finished? (Honestly I am unsure how anyone could claim this is an acceptable final version, just watch for some of the most flawed examples of ADR you're ever going to see) product there was no one or any thing that could've saved this nightmare from the fate it had created for itself.An experience that could only possibly come from a collective group who all gave up the fight to save it long before shooting had wrapped, Madame Web inexcusably comes from the same penmanship that was guilty of unleashing Morbius on us but screenwriters Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless at least managed to find some cult like goodness in Jared Leto and Matt Smith's wildly OTT characters and bizarre action segments but Madame Web is nothing more than two hours of terrible plot, characters, spectacle and intentions and there is quite literally no valid reason for this movie to exist in the form it has been given.One of the most atrociously acted Hollywood films ever captured, with lead Dakota Johnson unable to hold back her disdain for a film she clearly hated being a part of and poor old Tahar Rahim taking the films most unfortunate mantle from a wigged Sydney Sweeney, Madame Web may have been promoted as some type of intense action thriller following the exploits of Johnson's Cassandra Webb as she battles Rahim's Ezekiel Sims alongside Sweeney's Julia, Isabela Merced's Anya and Celeste O'Connor's Mattie but we get something else entirely that is hard to come to terms with.From some of the most detestable and frequent examples of product placement that becomes instantly iconic (some viewers may find themselves attempting to crack open a Pepsi can in their Calvin Klein's after a viewing), a villain we literally know nothing about with zero attempts to bother explaining his plans or background, an embarrassing use of comic staple characters that aren't even put into action outside of dream sequences and a script that must surely have been conjured on ChatGPT, Madame Web is a cesspool of Hollywood excrement that isn't even funny in its horribleness, just merely sad and depressing.The only justifiable reason for Madame Web to be the film it is as it stands is if Sony are deliberately attempting to sabotage their Marvel property that no longer is allowed to include many fan favourites, if they aren't in fact doing that there is zero excuses for why Madame Web has ever been allowed to be birthed into existence.An irredeemable, amateurish and embarrassing exercise in pointless, Madame Web is a shockingly bad example of blockbuster filmmaking that is the exact type of bottom feeder product the cinema industry and the Marvel brand didn't need at this particular point of time.Final Say -If you're a glutton for punishment and want to be reminded of everything you wouldn't wish to see in a supposed piece of big screen entertainment then Madame Web is for you! A truly iconic new addition to the staples of all-time misfires, nothing could prepare one for the garbage that is this $80 million dollar disasterpiece.0 fireworks to the head out of 5.Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)","1","22 February 2024"
"shaikhirshad-41223","Literally I had zero expectations when I went to watch this flick but I still thought that something should be good in this to watch at least one time because of marvel name in it. But this movie is so low and looks like low budget CGI thriller and a comedy in the name of superhero genre.I mean from the start itself movie lost it's pace and story and god only knows what are they showing no interest in the screenplay and the plot is not even engaging to watch for at least 30 mins.I only went for Dakota & Sydney just because the screen presence of them looks good, but the director loss this opportunity too. Because the character they're playing is so bad and not even proper dialogues are given and just they have made a common character with no story arc just the situation that they have to act
I've never seen such a bad cinematography of any film it looks like they don't have any interest making this film so they just made a spoof just to show that we are making a movie.

"vengeance20","Ok, so before people come at me with the ""YoU dIdN't LiKe It BeCaUsE iT wAs FeMaLe LeAd."" chestnut. I went into this one with an open mind, but expecting it to be as described & the reviews were right. The film is bad.The film sees Cassandra Webb who is a New York metropolis paramedic who begins to demonstrate signs of clairvoyance. Forced to challenge revelations about her past, she needs to safeguard 3 young girls from a deadly adversary who wants them destroyed.I found the film to be pretty bad. It's disjointed, clunky, poorly paced & just feels very awkward & stiff. The characters are personality-less, they look & sound as if they're reciting their lines from cue cards (almost robotic, I might add) & the script reads like a supermarket shopping receipt.The films story is all over the place, confusing & hard to follow. The premonition sequences the main lead experiences were annoying & while creative, were repetitive to the point where you couldn't tell if she was hallucinating or actually seeing what she was seeing.The films runtime is overly long for what it is, while not as bad as other films which are generally over 2 hours (rolls eyes), this film felt longer & as I said was too long for what it was at 1 hour & 48 minutes (108 minutes) without credits & the pacing, jeez... don't get me started.The actors were alright, but what they were given script wise, didn't work & made them come across as flat. There's some action & not bad effects to be had, but that's pretty much the only redeeming features from this flick, sadly. It hasn't a lot going for it & is pretty lack luster & basic.Don't get me wrong, I prefer films with straight forward story-lines & plots you can follow, but this one was a bit too basic & could've used more meatiness to beef it up more as well as more emphasis to keep the audience engaged with the story, characters, action etc.I generally didn't like the film & the ending is just out there too & is pretty cringy like some of the scenes in the film as well as the few cringy action sequences themselves among some of the good action we got.Overall, it's a bad film. And no, it's got nothing to do with the old chestnut of me being a man who doesn't like the film because it's female lead. The film was bad & had plenty of things wrong with it. People in general, men & women, boys & girls, didn't like this flick.The story is bland, boring & paper thin like the characters & leads, the little bit of good action & effects seen are overshadowed by the aforementioned issues as well as the other issues like the poor runtime, pacing & the lacking engagement the film has.Also, for those who can't seem to get it in their heads, there's been plenty of female lead films in the past that have done well, from the Alien Franchise to The Hunger Games along with Elektra, Tomb Raider, Salt, Lucy, Hanna etc. I could go on but that's my rant for those who need calling out.2/10.","2","20 February 2024"

"alindsayal","With Marvel Studios taking on more responsibility involving Spider-Man, Sony have decided to try and build a universe involving smaller characters from the same lore as him. We have had Venom and Morbius and will get Kraven The Hunter later this year but here we have Madame Web. I saw this film last night and here is my review for Madame Web. The p[remise of the film sees a women bestowed with powers where she has to save 3 girls from being killed by a villainous foe.Main Character
I must be honest that I have never been a huge fan of Dakota Johnson and she plays Cassandra Web here and I have to be honest she isn't particularly good here. She is overacting everything here and her character is super unlikeable and hard to care about. She is clearly hampered by the awful writing in this film and she can't rise above it and give us a lead role to support or care about and Cassie Web will go down as one of the worst leads in a comic book film ever.Supporting Characters
Sydney Sweeney, Isabela Merced & Celeste O'Connor play the three girls that are in the view of the villain and they are all pretty awful. Their characters are really awkward and not particularly likeable, the film tries to force you to like and care about these characters but it comes across poorly and these actresses aren't good enough to make me care.Tahar Rahim plays Ezekiel Sims and he is one of the more frustrating parts of this film because I have seen him be a good actor and this character had some potential but the film really flops here and makes him this over the top villain that is so stupid that it really takes you out of the film.Adam Scott as Ben Parker is probably the best person here but he isn't really given much to do and it still upsets me that he plays Ben Parker and it is really clear that this was just done to provide some stupid fan service that actually annoys me even more.Story
The story is nonsensical and completely stupid. The plot makes no sense and characters do things that make no sense, Cassie Web in particular is one of the dumbest characters that I have seen in recent movies. This film also tries its best to ruin the character of Spider-Man even though he isn't in the film and it is just the backdrop to this pretty dull and horrendous adventure.Script
This is a really awfully written film. Things make no sense, characters are unlikeable and there is no humour here at all. There are so many plot holes it is crazy and the film has nothing interesting about it at all.Style
I mean I guess the action scenes are okay and the bad guys suit was okay but that is it. The film is filmed really poorly, the editing looks unfinished and at times it is actually quite jarring to watch it. There are way too many jump scares especially for a film that is not a horror film. The trailer shows things that barely happen in the film and it feels like we were sold a different film that never got made.Overall
Overall, Madame Web is a truly disastrous film. This is up there with one of the worst films I have ever seen and is up there with the worst comic book films of all time. Though I am glad I saw this film to have this experience but at all cost avoid this garbage and do something better for 2 hours.Rating - 1/10.","1","16 February 2024"
"daisukereds","A baby-sitting movie in a Superhero setting, where the lead can see the future and has to prevent NOT-Spiderman from killing teenagers (because he has dreams/visions about them). The girls run and hide around a lot, some BS happens and then the movie ends.The foundation of the script is heavily written around a hollow core of ""parents and children"". The cinematography is actually good, and at least ""teaches"" how to do CPR. It also does away with showing premonitions every time something is to be changed near the end.. respecting the viewers intelligence in at least that aspect! And it's easy to follow (if you don't fall asleep) with how simplistic it is.Aside from that, it is barely anything else..
The movie itself isn't terrible.. it's just beyond bland and boring. Also, calling this a Superhero movie is really disingenuous and a marketing ploy to get people to see it. Stay home! There are no good action sequences and nobody is written memorably....
Venom making money was a mistake. Sony has half a franchise, and they can't get anyone talented enough to do something with it. And what they continue to release seems like high-budgeted fan fiction!","3","16 February 2024"
"isaacsundaralingam","Yea, this was garbage and that's saying plenty. It's actually adorable how little anyone cared about ""Madame Web"" - not just the audience, but the filmmakers and actors themselves. Written by the same people who wrote ""Morbius"", this movie is yet another reason to not let them anywhere near a writing software ever again.Not only was the movie unwatchable due to how lifeless it was, but it was also criminally boring. You're waiting for something to happen and you keep waiting right until the credits start to roll. Nothing about the movie was compelling, the plot was riddled with plot holes, the screenplay was lazy, the dialogues were dead and the acting was almost as if the actors were held captive and being forced to act as if everything was okay. It reeks of corporate greed and there isn't a single positive thing to say about this movie.We're only a month and half into the year and we already have a very strong contender for what might be the worst movie of the year, and it's not even close. Don't watch it, but if you do indeed decide to, I hope you lived a life well enough to have a crowded funeral.","1","19 February 2024"
"syntory","Look at the profiles for the writers that wrote Madame Web. You'll see virtually every movie they've written has a bad rating and bad reviews. Why then does Hollywood continually hire these same writers for these big budget films? I could understand if they wrote movies for Asylum Films because all their movies are terrible.Madame Web is god awful! Very difficult to sit through. None of the main characters are likeable. Even the villain is lame. It seems like the entire movie was written to set up a sequel. But why would people spend money to see the sequel of a movie that is one of the worst movies ever written? I'm shocked at how bad this movie is and if there is a sequel I certainly wont bother watching it.Stop hiring bad writers, Hollywood!","2","15 February 2024"

It has terrible writing, characters, action setpieces and even acting. Dakota Johnson is so dull and boring as the main lead but this is probably down to the terrible script.To be fair, the movie does have an interesting concept with this Final Destination x Terminator thing. However, it is so poorly executed that it makes Morbius look like The Dark Knight.Anyway give me the ""He Was in the Amazon With My Mom When She Was Researching Spiders Right Before She Died"" cut!","1","17 February 2024"
"chenp-54708","Literally one of the worst superhero movies I have ever seen.From the advertisements, I knew this movie wasn't going to be great but still, it surprised me how bad and boring it was. Everything about the direction, writing, characters, technical aspects, and designs are really awful. The writing is poor as there are many concepts, ideas and aspects that are messy and bland. The messy script creates poor dialogue from the cast and the characters are not interesting. The special effects looked even worse than the marketing and all of the performances were pretty bad. I honestly do feel bad for Dakota Johnson cause she is a good actress but she deserves to have better roles then this. It can be said for the same for the rest of the cast members.The uses of product placements are annoying, action moments are dull, and and all in all, it was boring. Superhero movies shouldn't be boring but this really dragged on. It's unfortunate cause female superhero leads are something I love to see more like Wonder Woman and The Old Guard which are pretty fun. But unfortunately, it seemed that it likely isn't going to happen anytime soon.There really isn't anything else to say.Bad.","1","14 February 2024"
"AlsExGal","... when I saw Dakota Johnson was starring in it. Naturally I can't lay the entirety of this hot mess at her feet. But there is some really bad campy acting happening on her part, reminiscent of the Fifty Shades of Grey movies in which she starred. Perhaps it was because the director was more interested in the placement of Pepsi cans than her performance, but I digress.Basically, this movie plays out like the cut scenes from a budget Xbox 360 game. From the ground up this thing just feels designed to fail. It feels almost Producersesque in its approach in just how every aspect is seemingly intentionally mangled, yet no one seems to care. How have we come so full circle to go through the glory of Infinity War/Logan/The Dark Knight to arrive all the way back to Batman and Robin and Catwoman levels of superhero flicks? (Bam!, Pow!, Gosh yes Batman!)How did this movie make it so far that it has an actual release, and no one stopped it? How did this idea get green lit? Why did Sony give 80 million and turn over their valuable IP to the people that wrote Morbius, Gods of Egypt, Dracula Untold and The Last Witch Hunter? How did this get past the writing process and again have that script greenlit? How could no one on the set at any point stop things? How did no one in the editing room point out how bad it looked and how much of a mess it was?But to the suits it's not about art and story. Instead it's about business, and people are just a commodity. It's cheaper to recycle known quantities, and practice nepotism and involve maybe less than talented friends, people you've worked with before, than go out and find artists with worthy stories. They don't care about art, they don't care about stories, they care about making this work for them financially, regardless of loss of reputation with audiences as a whole.Youtuber Chris Stuckmann did a deep dive on the topic of big studios being generally run by folks who came up through management rather than the creative rungs such as writing and directing when he discussed this film. His take is worth watching. For some reason, Chris doesn't do critical movie reviews since he has become a filmmaker, but I can tell by his tone that, like me, he was completely displeased watching this one. I'd avoid it.","2","17 February 2024"
"eoinageary","This is, well I guess this is a movie in the Sony universe that I'm SHOCKED is profitable.The story is all over the place, it's basically about Madame Web who is a paramedic and develops powers and can see into the future, with a current threat she tries to change the future, teaming up with 3 powerful characters who are yet to develop into their full potential so she must shield them and change the future to protect them.Trying not to give the little story that gets told away in the opening there but i have to be vague.What I liked, one or two good scenes, I didn't mind the end, I really liked a lot of the camera work some cool looking shots and a decent Score.But the movie is BAD, it makes Morbius look like The Batman 2022. The acting is lacking, the actors look as bored as you will feel. Script is bad, just some beyond silly lines, the story chops and changes so much your neck will hurt you, some bad CGI, and just boring action.And before people harp on about ""you don't like it because it's women leads"" no, it's just a crap film, I enjoyed the marvels, Black Widow was decent, so no, the movie regardless of its leads is just poor.Extremely disappointing, 3/10.","3","14 February 2024"
"tbunker-88294","I can honestly say that once again (not that anyone is surprised) that Sony has bombed again with its superhero content. Underwhelming action, bad characters, weird dialogue, generic villain. Its just plain badI feel bad for the cast of this movie, you have EXCELLENT talent and its just wasted in this cash grab excuse of a movieSony has proved once again it can't be trusted with superhero content and has lost what little credibility it had. If the company had any integrity or wits left they should sell their share of ownership back to Marvel and let them assume FULL creative control.I'm not optimistic for Kraven The Hunter after seeing this gross disappointment.","1","14 February 2024"
"hotrobinproductions","Horrible from beginning to end, the opening scene just reeks of awful predictability from story & plot to the core. You know exactly what will happen before it even happens, the script sucks & the dialogue is even worse. There is quite noticeable audio dub edited after the fact too. This budget is 80 million, not that budget matters, because no amount of money could have saved this train wreck, but I mention this because you can still make a good film on lower budgets, Shazam, the first one, had the same budget & delt with a lot of side characters too, it's miles better, Godzilla minus one had a extremely low budget too. But this 80 million dollar film not just effects but production, feels obviously cheap, it almost feels like watching a very long pilot episode to a CW tv show.You thought Morbius was bad, that film was bad because it did the bare minimum, this film doesn't even do the bare minimum, it goes beyond comprehension below that, it just enters a point of no originality or ambition towards creating anything. There isn't even a single superhero moment, even horrible films like catwoman or Morbius has superhero moments & action, this thing doesn't, you get instead visions of the future to potentially set up sequels.This movie also has a serious problem of product placement, it's a long commercial, to be exact a long Pepsi commercial, I feel like Pepsi stopped the halftime show so they could invest in the product placement in this film. This movie was more important to them than the superbowl LOL it's just so over the top & obviously placed way too much in this film. Calvin Klein, Chase bank, the list goes on. This movie should be called superhero product placement the movie.It's barely even close to a 1/10 the cool moments are seeing what we already saw in the trailer when she's seeing the future & you think it's happening now but then it goes back to the moment she realizes it's a vision, granted it's cool the first couple times but it gets old REAL quick. & it ends up getting annoying because it's abused way too much.Thats about it, there isn't any redeeming things in this film, the acting isn't even good. I would say the 3 side character spider women that Dakota finds when they are together there was a potential spark. I saw the talent & potential, but they are failed big time by such a horrid script that the spark never even sparks, it's just like showing you the matches & gasoline & not setting the fire.Madame M0RBIUS / 10.","1","16 February 2024"
"olcare","It's the worst movie and superhero adaptation I've watched in recent years. Completely atrocious effects, atrocious screenplay, and atrocious acting. Also, a big insult to all comic book readers and those who know the original story.Let me describe the movie simply. First of all, I am filled with hatred; I really want to curse the entire creative team for this unacceptable film.All the performances are bad, everyone. There's not a single good actor trying; everyone just took the role for money. It's a terrible disgrace, a total eclipse of reason.The screenplay is the worst superhero screenplay I've ever seen. It barely resembles the original story, and if there aren't scenes like the other Spider-Girls in the trailer, why include them? There's no such obligation; instead, write a decent screenplay. All action scenes are full of logical errors; they've written it without thinking, it's complete garbage.Apart from these, the direction, sorry to say, is garbage too. Most scenes are shot as if they were taken straight from a phone camera; action scenes are not shown, they're hidden due to the atrociousness of the effects. It's shameful.After these general points, Sony urgently needs to cancel this universe; the original stories are garbage, there's no logic, no connection anywhere. They're just being shot randomly. I don't like to curse, but I hope this film sinks at the box office.The last scene with Madame Web gaining her powers, those web effects, clinging to souls, it's unbelievable how you approved this film, may God punish you.I don't know which one to talk about; all the atrocities are collected in this film. Whether it's the woman going to Peru and back in 30 seconds, Spider-Man dodging with fireworks, dancing at the boys' table when my daughters are left alone, not telling the story of the Spider-Human community, or the woman talking normally while giving birth at the end, everything is a disgrace. I hope this universe sinks, and you all get fired. No one involved in the management of this film deserves their job respectfully; they should quit immediately.Note: Dakota Johnson made a statement saying she didn't watch the movie. Why are you serving a completely garbage film if you're not going to watch it? Life shouldn't be all about money for you; we, in our poverty, are trying to watch it, and this is no different from cursing all the audience's families. Shame on you.Note 2: Just now, I looked at the budget of the movie, and my anger grew even more, 80 million dollars EIGHTY MILLION. How can I not believe this money, I really can't believe it, it's nothing but disrespect to yourself, disrespect to the audience, nothing but an insult.","1","16 February 2024"
"sinscopefilms","First Impression:The opening of the Madame Web was immersed in a mystique and ambition, enhanced by great musical score; yet, as the movie progresses, it becomes a mixed bag and a rollercoaster of emotions.The Positive:Musical Score and Sound Design: The standout feature of ""Madame Web"" is its musical score. The soundtrack not only enhances the emotional depth of the film but also succeeds in creating in some moments genuine goosebumps. The sound design really enhances this impact by carefully using sound pans, bass, and reverse effects. It creates a sense of tension and immersion which is one of the film's strongest features.The Mixed:Visual Effects and Costume Design: Some of the visual effects in ""Madame Web"" were visually appealing. The costume design, like Casey's red jacket and the three spider girl villain outfits standing out as particularly stunning contributions to the film's aesthetic, but it was not often shown in the film since the films direction and focus was different. I was disappointed.Acting and Direction: Although I thought Casey's character development - her ability to see the world from a different perspective - was great, I didn't like how it was visually presented. The way it was edited was poorly done. The editor could use 2 distinct color grading features where one sees the future and two, she sees the present moment.However, The performances throughout the film feel lackluster, with the actors appearing confused and disengaged. This, combined with direction that fails to maintain interest or coherence in many scenes, significantly undermines the film's potential.Negatives:Cinematography: Cinematography is bad since some pictures don't show a clear image. The camera moves so fast that I cannot comprehend the picture. I kind of recognized that it tries to initiate the rapidness of the events from the spider's eye point of view but it was a tasteless decision. The Cinematography is not something like wow. The reason why Cinematography was lacking is because it was heavily based on medium closeups and dutch tilts which on one hand was a unique choice but on the other hand very hard to watch. I found the 180 degree round camera rotations super cool, but again, I expected varied distance shots, not just medium shots. The train scene Cinematography was the best in the film.Editing and Pace: The editing is arguably the weakest element of ""Madame Web,"" with its rapid cuts and disjointed flow detracting significantly from the storytelling. This lack of coherence makes it challenging for the audience to fully engage with the narrative.Plot and Overall Execution: The storyline of ""Madame Web"" is cluttered and clichéd, suffering from a lack of originality and clear direction. The film's ambition is evident, but the execution falls short of creating a compelling narrative.The Conclusion:""Madame Web"" presents a paradoxical experience, with exceptional music and sound design standing that sharply contrasts with its various flaws in editing, cinematography, and direction.Although there are some visually and emotionally stunning moments, they are frequently overshadowed by a lack of coherence and clarity.Also, I think this film would be reasonable and great to be incorporated in a TV series which would have allowed for a more in-depth exploration of characters and plot.Nevertheless, Madame Web is a bit of a mixed bag, with moments of potential that ultimately leave the viewer something different visually.Rating: 3/10.","3","15 February 2024"
"Skruffbagg","Cannon, is that you in disguise?I firmly believe Madame Web will go down in history as not only the worst superhero movie, but also one of the worst movies ever made. It's that bad. It's absolutely fascinating to behold.Now, I'll be honest with you here. I only went to see this because I had heard it was an unmitigated disaster that had to be seen to be believed, and it truly does not disappoint - or massively does, depending on your viewpoint.It takes a special kind of director to get such cringe-inducing performances out of a fairly talented cast (Dakota Johnson and Tahar Rahim are both quality actors with the right script and direction), but SJ Clarkson somehow manages to wrangle the absolute worst imaginable from every single person in the film. I'll be very surprised if she ever does another feature after this.Nothing in this film works; the plot is moronic, the script seems like it was written by a teenager, the cinematography is horrendous, the aformentioned embarrassing performances, the audio editing is baffling (so much dubbing, brain-melting music choices). I'm amazed this didn't get shelved the minute the final cut was done.To me, I rate this as ""so bad it's good"" as I wasn't bored watching it, but most people I assume will say it's just plain bad... and it is, but very entertainingly so.If you love watching a 2hr car crash then I highly recommend this. The awfulness is mind-boggling in it's complexity, but in the best possible way. Film scholars and historians will be analysing this movie for years to come, and I hope it is talked about in the same vein as The Room in the future.An absolutely epic misfire on all levels.","1","20 February 2024"
"MiroslavKyuranov","It's astonishing to think that Sony could put out a worse product than 2022's Morbius, but boy, ""Madame Web"" manages it. It is an embarrassing mess. Talented stars wasted on probably one of the worst comic book movie ever (which nobody asked for). Filled with atrocious dialogue, awkward editing and laughable structure. It's a clunky, poorly-written, messy, and sloppy movie packed with some mediocre editing and performances.The concept is interesting on paper, but it couldn't be saved due to it's terrible execution. ""Madame Web"" simply lacked the spark it needed in nearly every dept.There is simply nothing memorable in this movie, except maybe some superhero costumes, but that doesn't redeem the fact that the movie is bad.So yeah...""Madame Web"" is yet another disappointing entry in the Sony's Spider-Less universe. It's like a love letter to an era of superhero films that people largely want to forget. The ""Pepsi"" adds are stand-out, it falls short of what could have been a decent movie in the hands of someone else twenty years ago.","4","14 February 2024"
"darrelltill","There is nothing good in this film. It's badly written - not just full of clichés but full of dialogue that is meant to sound like cliché superhero idioms yet butchered until they make no sense. It is nothing but a costume parade with players that are dead behind the eyes. You can tell that everybody involved knows it's going to be a stinker but they'd already signed on and it was too late. It would be great if this was the flop that made Disney rethink their output (I know, this is actually an SSU movie not an MCU movie, but they are all heading down the same path) but I fear it will take a few more. The solution is really simple - they need to adjust their hiring policy to include persons of talent.","1","15 February 2024"
"movieman6-413-929510","Madame Web is a new spin-off set in the Marvel Spider-Man world. This spin-off is directed, partly written and produced by S. J. Clarkson. Before this film, she directed more TV series episodes of superhero shows such as Jessica Jones and The Defenders.Cassandra Webb (Dakota Johnson) works as a paramedic in New York and learns after an accident that she has superpowers to see future possibilities. She sees that the lives of three girls are threatened by a mysterious masked man with spider-like powers.This is why she tries to protect the three girls and must convince them that their lives are really in danger. To truly protect them, they must ensure that the three listen to her and learn to work together.The story of this film has an interesting concept, but the final story and screenplay were written by five different writers. These writers do not always seem to have been on the same page, because the story sometimes seems a bit rushed or frayed. It sometimes seems as if they didn't really know what exactly to do with it, or what the film studio despised of them. The screenplay has also been rewritten many times, so the cast members could no longer always follow exactly where they were going or supposed to do with the film.Despite these messy, rushed aspects, the film remains on a familiar, predictable side for a superhero film. This can make the film seem a bit long-winded or embarrassing. The film is reminiscent of other superhero films that came out around the year 2000, but of a somewhat lesser quality.The visual effects don't always look believable either. The blue screen and CGI can be seen in the film. For some of the cast members, this was also the first time they had actually worked in a film with such visual effects. The fact that they have little or no experience with these film situations is sometimes reflected in their acting.The poor script also gives the cast members few opportunities to make something special of their roles. Dakota Johnson also seemed a bit uncomfortable during promotions of the film, or ignorant of how to properly promote this film. In the final film she tries to make the best of the role and tries to add some comedy to the role, but she doesn't always get the chance to do this. Sydney Sweeney, Isabela Merced and Celeste O'Connor play the three girls Cassandra tries to protect. All three are given a little time to give their characters some personalities, but unfortunately not enough to make you as a viewer really care about the three. For a better focused film, they might have been better off using a character in the story, who Cassandra then has to protect. Tahar Rahim plays the villain in the film, who tries to kill the three girls, but also deals with the poor, weak script. As a result, he does not emerge as strongly as the villain of the story. They also didn't incorporate his audio work well into the film, because his lips sometimes don't always match what his character is saying.With all these superhero spin-off films from the Sony film studio, they only make Marvel's current film series more messy. If Sony and Disney Marvel try to collaborate on the same film series, they will have to consult each other more and better and plan where they want to go with this film series.","2","17 February 2024"
"ethanbresnett","Based on Madame Web's woeful reviews I was expecting this film to be an utter car crash. To its credit I will say it isn't entirely without merit, but it is incredibly boring and bland.Mostly this is because nothing particularly happens. It's a superhero movie with little to no superhero action and a painfully long set up for an underwhelming final act. The characters are so underdeveloped that there is no emotional connection or investment in any of them. Everything about the story and writing just feels lazy, vacuous and corny.Then there's the villain who is utterly uninspiring. He is constantly complaining about 'everything he has built' being destroyed. What has he built you might ask? The film has no interest in exploring this question. He's easily one of the more two dimensional and weak superhero villains I've ever seen committed to screen.Perhaps the most heinous crime this movie commits is to waste the talents of Dakota Johnson, Sydney Sweeney, Adam Scott, Emma Roberts, Zosia Mamet and more. Such a good cast was assembled and they were given absolutely nothing to work with, so I don't blame the performers. It's just such a shame to see such great talent put to the sword like this.As if all of this wasn't enough, the movie also feels remarkably low budget and feels excruciatingly long despite its relatively short runtime.Ultimately I think this film suffered because it was clearly intended as a set up for a wider Spider-Woman franchise which is unlikely to come to fruition. There seemed to be no interest in making a good stand alone movie, and no respect for the audience. A massive waste of time.","3","21 February 2024"
"vfphvnpp","I understand what the plan was here. They wanted a trippy film, focusing on a strong future for the Sony verse. The problem is the delivery. The camera work in this movie made it quite irritating to follow, as there was constant quick close up shots of the action. The dialogue was awful, and there was quite a lot of blatant voice over during the villain scenes.So much wasted time was given to boring scenes in the movie, which led me to believe the screen writers finished the script and realised that it was under the word count.Honestly the acting quality was quite poor across the board, especially the villain, who honestly seems as if they didn't cast for his role at all, just picked up someone off the side of the road.For someone who's guilty pleasure is watching bad movies, I it was a painful time. Don't recommend.","2","14 February 2024"
"jtorch-11283","Don't waste your time, and money seeing this in theaters. I was fooled by the trailer which looked promising. All the action in the whole film ( a total of 2 scenes) is shown in the the trailer. The rest of the movie is just terrible acting trying to save an even worse scrip.I'm honestly not sure how this made it to the big screen. I'm not a cinema expert, but shouldn't someone have to view the finished product and give the O. K. At some point before it is ""audience ready?"" I feel like that step in the process was skipped. I don't know what Marvel had to do with this film, but it certainly isn't the Iron-Man-Marvel I keep hoping they will somehow revive.And to whom it may concern, ""my parents don't love me."" Is neither a solid backstory OR a strong character trait. I hope you eat a lot of money on this movie.","1","15 February 2024"
"cosby_don","I don't know where to start-actually, I do! THIS IS THE WORST MOVIE IN THE HISTORY OF HUMANITY. I'm not kidding.I'm not sure what other movie this Dakota Johnson has been in, but after watching THIS movie, I'll probably never support her again. This was an absolute career killer. Ms. Johnson, please FIRE your agent immediately.To the production crew, editors, director, and ESPECIALLY the writers (I counted 4 writers-that's RIDICULOUS), shame on you for contributing to this mess. It's obvious you've traded in your morals for a paycheck. That's Hollywood for ya'.Did I mention that this movie was HORRENDOUSLY bad? Everything about this movie was bad-there are ZERO redeeming qualities.The story: STUPID. Worst I've ever seen, seriously. Madam Web ask the girls to wait for 3 hours in the woods? STUPID. The guy partner keeping the girls as Madam Web flies to Peru to check something out. STUPID. Madam a Web getting her powers from a spider bite through her mother. STUPID. I could seriously go on and on. I'm not kidding-EVERYTHING in this movie was STUPID. I can't count how many times I shook my head and said ""This is so bad.""The acting? Very wooden. Ms. Dakota Johnson's acting chops were the worst of the worst here. I really pray that she's done work much better. The other girls-they tried. Jokes fell flat, and they said the DUMBEST lines ever in a movie. I was seriously angry at how dumb they were.The villain? The most generic, uninteresting, uncool villain over ever seen on film. Not one memorable quote. Come to think, did he even make a ""evil guy"" speech? Nope!The ending? Oh my, HORRENDOUS. She's smiling in her glasses while paralyzed in a wheel chair?

"rgkarim","LIKES:The Commentary At Times
-Some lines in this movie are startling at how funny they were for me, a fantastic bout of teenage emotions with a less than thrilled babysitter.-Madame Web's origin story is almost like an anti-hero tale to Charles Xavier idea, and though it's not fully fleshed out, there is emotion, fun, and what felt natural angst and vulnerability into it.-With the right timing, and build up, this section of commentary was a striking positive in this reviewers book.Representation of Paramedics
-It's a rare thing to get to actually see E. M. T's in their work and what they give to serve the public.-While a bit forced, and perhaps a tad overdone and cheesy, kudos for Madame Web accomplishing some detailed shots of them serving the public and giving a little character development with it.-There were great avenues taken to help ingrain parts into the story, and with that, the medical nerd inside me found a cool little nod in those sequences.Some Artistic Visuals Are Cool
-I'm a sucker for a good shot and a good artistic visual popping out and ingraining itself into my mind.-Madame Web has some of these moments for me, the creepy and yet serene world of the Web World, being one that holds majesty and mystery, but also the very emotions of the person trying to wield it.-Other shots of costume crusaders striking that right pose, or perhaps that nostalgic early 2000s look, really help establish some of the themes of the movie or a good set up visual to cascade into.-It may be sprinkled about, but there were some superhero visuals that accomplished the job for me in Madame Web.Talented Cast
-Celeste O'Connor is very fun in this movie. A tad quirky, but she keeps the attitude going, a lot of that sass very fun and usually well-placed to help move the story towards forced comedy and obvious story telling.-Merced eventually grew on me after she got into the meat of her character and starting to push past the stubborn and cheeky attitude. She's got charming charisma, a fun brainy side to exploit, and this sadness that she uses to illicit such emotion, something I wanted more of, but got only little.-Sweeney is fun in this movie. Toned down from the other roles I've seen, the woman knows how to adapt her style and give me something to hook to several times. I love the awkwardness she brings, the tie in to the two extremes, and her surprising smallness after she plays such big roles.-And Johnson is about the same as she always is. A snarky and condescending nature that she wields expertly, but a tad dry at times that some lines feel unfulfilled. Fortunately, she's got good chemistry with the girls that assisted in smoothing out the faults.Some Surprising Character Arcs
-The movie may miss a lot of things, but there are a few moments that work very well to show the potential of Madame Web if given the right focus.-An opening that holds some merit was one of the victories, something that would eventually bleed into plot points further on that gave you a very touching moment.-And another element has the other's origin stories granting us some potential hurt and relatable tales to latch onto and acknowledge. Again, helping give a young and in your face Charlie's Angel group some vim and vigor.The Music
-Call me a sucker for nostalgia, Madame Web has a mix of songs that were perfect for viewers like me to enjoy.-Comedic use of the songs are not the most creative, but add that minor element to help give the girls a little more dynamic and believability.-While other times, it's just a blast of the speakers and me dancing in my seat as the forgotten wonder returns for another run to get things started.DISLIKES:The Pacing Uneven
-Despite the trinkets and some merits to the story, Madame Web's dislikes for me start with the pacing of the tale.-A moderately slow start did little to keep me engaged, only to then have these sprints of faster moments to try to change things up, before hitting the brakes again.-Like a CW season crammed into one, Madame Web's pacing feels a lot like dressed up teenage drama trying to give realism and gradual steps, but really just being the mashup of the uglier time use dramas can get stuck to.The Stale Mechanic
-From the trailers, you know there is some type of vision gimmick that Cassie is supposed to use to protect her charges.-That gimmick gets stale very quickly for a viewer like me, the convoluted presentation starting out fun at first, but then turning into annoying déjà vu that felt more like reshoots than actual artistic twisting.-Like Moon Knight, that element makes sense at first, but really could have stopped halfway through the movie once the viewers has connected the powers.-Had there been a bit more excitement, fighting, or even better storytelling to distract, it would have been less impactful, but alas, for me, all the other limitations added up.Lack of Other Character Development
-There are a lot of characters in this movie, some played by bigger names than the leads themselves. And yet, their time and character development felt shoehorned than planned out.-Adam Scott and Emma Roberts seem disengaged, with stories that are cliché, simplistic, and a waste of talent that again showed potential with that slower pacing at the start.-But even the villain and main girls tales feel very bland, and that lack of character development was very much felt by me that it almost seems to rely heavily on another movie to do these characters justice.Annoying Dialogue
-I know, I said the commentary was good, but that was a small amount of it compared to the whole.-Madame Web's dialogue seems to have gone through the writing grinder several times, very loaded with one liners, sassy comments and attitude that seemed to be out of place for much of the film for me.-Statements of the obvious, corny dialogue essentially pushed in with too simplistic of writing and in your face, overdramatic flair to count as quality dialogue. It needs tuning up, needs to be less forceful, and try to add a little Hollywood magic to help tenderize it to something matching a comic book movie.A Villain Needing A Lot More
-Don't get me wrong, there is an element to him that is relatable, believable, and indeed threatening in terms of the madness of his actions.-But outside of this and the opening scene, Ezekiel is a very bland bad guy who just didn't get the time to shine outside of crawling and repeating the same lines over and over.-The direction failed to give him any recognizable skills, his threats empty most of the time and sort of creepy obsessive, and dare I say his actual character is zoomed over and practically absent but for the opening line.-To me, that's a limited villain and one major flaw that much of the movie suffers from.Visuals Get Really Muddy/Bad
-Sony makes such great looking video games, and yet their movies still suffer from last gen effects
-While the artistic flair of those moments was enjoyable, they did have that faux effect that dropped some of the realism this movie was going for.-Even worse, there are lots of movements, character renderings, and powers that leave a lot to be desired in looking their best. I won't say it's a dealbreaker, but it doesn't help to have such limited technology presentation.Scenes/Story Seem Very Chopped Up
-Between the gimmicks and pacing, the scenes already feel limited, messy, and almost like an abbreviated version of what they could be.-Sure, the dialogue gives you everything they are going for, but the presentation felt very much like a lot of reshoots of the same scene, and slight changes that made little difference.-Such indecisive direction and edits got away from them and left me just wondering what this film could have been with half the gimmicks of the visions pulled back.The Action Is Very Boring
-No denying this, Madame Web maybe even worse than many of the CW attempts at action.-While witty, and an amusing game of cat and mouse, a Spiderverse without a solid one or two fights is a verse I'm not fond playing in for nearly two hours.-A lame villain does little but strut and crawl, while our cast somehow running away and eluding comes off a bit pathetic than entertaining.-Even the climax is a mess, rushed finishes, suspense of disbelief, and an overdramatic battle of words with a very extravagant and mushy ending to cap it off.-Eternals at least had a few moves that had me rocking in my seat, but this... this was a challenge to stay awake in.The VERDICT:
Madame Web is certainly not the worst movie I've seen in years, but that doesn't mean Sony's latest is a masterpiece either. There are elements of this vision that show the potential for a good future, but need a lot of work to make up for this rushed installment. A talented cast, music and some fun writing can be the starting building blocks, but it can't offset what feels like lots of production limitations, rewrites, and editing that greatly show in this movie. Boring battles, annoying gimmicks, and under developed characters despite a strong cast were just some of the limitations this movie has to work through if a series is to come with it. Should one see it in theaters? Not really. A shot at home, I would say sure, but with all of this, my scores for the movie are:Action/Adventure/Sci-Fi: 6.0
Movie Overall: 5.0.","5","15 February 2024"
"eddie_baggins","I'm not ashamed to admit I've seen some movies in my time.I am however ashamed to admit curiosity got the better of me and I ended up in an almost entirely empty cinema screening (thanks to one tolerant movie buddy who joined me on my trip to the local cinema) partaking in what can only be described as one of the most universally panned Hollywood blockbusters of the modern era.Not at all interested in watching another Sony Marvel outing after their last few efforts, hearing about the insanely awesome awfulness of Madame Web from friends, internet identities and esteemed critics made me want to witness a potential all-time cringe-fest and while when people are absolutely right in their hyperbole around just how bad Madame Web is, I'm still trying to comprehend how I could possibly testify to just how bad things are here.Directed by long time TV episode director S. J. Clarkson and featuring a cast of performers who have all proven over time to be more than capable of bringing the goods, Madame Web is not devoid of talent that may have been able to salvage some type of goodness from an offence against the entire cinematic medium but as a finished? (Honestly I am unsure how anyone could claim this is an acceptable final version, just watch for some of the most flawed examples of ADR you're ever going to see) product there was no one or any thing that could've saved this nightmare from the fate it had created for itself.An experience that could only possibly come from a collective group who all gave up the fight to save it long before shooting had wrapped, Madame Web inexcusably comes from the same penmanship that was guilty of unleashing Morbius on us but screenwriters Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless at least managed to find some cult like goodness in Jared Leto and Matt Smith's wildly OTT characters and bizarre action segments but Madame Web is nothing more than two hours of terrible plot, characters, spectacle and intentions and there is quite literally no valid reason for this movie to exist in the form it has been given.One of the most atrociously acted Hollywood films ever captured, with lead Dakota Johnson unable to hold back her disdain for a film she clearly hated being a part of and poor old Tahar Rahim taking the films most unfortunate mantle from a wigged Sydney Sweeney, Madame Web may have been promoted as some type of intense action thriller following the exploits of Johnson's Cassandra Webb as she battles Rahim's Ezekiel Sims alongside Sweeney's Julia, Isabela Merced's Anya and Celeste O'Connor's Mattie but we get something else entirely that is hard to come to terms with.From some of the most detestable and frequent examples of product placement that becomes instantly iconic (some viewers may find themselves attempting to crack open a Pepsi can in their Calvin Klein's after a viewing), a villain we literally know nothing about with zero attempts to bother explaining his plans or background, an embarrassing use of comic staple characters that aren't even put into action outside of dream sequences and a script that must surely have been conjured on ChatGPT, Madame Web is a cesspool of Hollywood excrement that isn't even funny in its horribleness, just merely sad and depressing.The only justifiable reason for Madame Web to be the film it is as it stands is if Sony are deliberately attempting to sabotage their Marvel property that no longer is allowed to include many fan favourites, if they aren't in fact doing that there is zero excuses for why Madame Web has ever been allowed to be birthed into existence.An irredeemable, amateurish and embarrassing exercise in pointless, Madame Web is a shockingly bad example of blockbuster filmmaking that is the exact type of bottom feeder product the cinema industry and the Marvel brand didn't need at this particular point of time.Final Say -If you're a glutton for punishment and want to be reminded of everything you wouldn't wish to see in a supposed piece of big screen entertainment then Madame Web is for you! A truly iconic new addition to the staples of all-time misfires, nothing could prepare one for the garbage that is this $80 million dollar disasterpiece.0 fireworks to the head out of 5.Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)","1","22 February 2024"
"shaikhirshad-41223","Literally I had zero expectations when I went to watch this flick but I still thought that something should be good in this to watch at least one time because of marvel name in it. But this movie is so low and looks like low budget CGI thriller and a comedy in the name of superhero genre.I mean from the start itself movie lost it's pace and story and god only knows what are they showing no interest in the screenplay and the plot is not even engaging to watch for at least 30 mins.I only went for Dakota & Sydney just because the screen presence of them looks good, but the director loss this opportunity too. Because the character they're playing is so bad and not even proper dialogues are given and just they have made a common character with no story arc just the situation that they have to act
I've never seen such a bad cinematography of any film it looks like they don't have any interest making this film so they just made a spoof just to show that we are making a movie. Don't know what to say more because this film is that bad.Overall a Boring fest and a spoof fo a superhero genre.","2","16 February 2024"
"vengeance20","Ok, so before people come at me with the ""YoU dIdN't LiKe It BeCaUsE iT wAs FeMaLe LeAd."" chestnut. I went into this one with an open mind, but expecting it to be as described & the reviews were right. The film is bad.The film sees Cassandra Webb who is a New York metropolis paramedic who begins to demonstrate signs of clairvoyance. Forced to challenge revelations about her past, she needs to safeguard 3 young girls from a deadly adversary who wants them destroyed.I found the film to be pretty bad. It's disjointed, clunky, poorly paced & just feels very awkward & stiff. The characters are personality-less, they look & sound as if they're reciting their lines from cue cards (almost robotic, I might add) & the script reads like a supermarket shopping receipt.The films story is all over the place, confusing & hard to follow. The premonition sequences the main lead experiences were annoying & while creative, were repetitive to the point where you couldn't tell if she was hallucinating or actually seeing what she was seeing.The films runtime is overly long for what it is, while not as bad as other films which are generally over 2 hours (rolls eyes), this film felt longer & as I said was too long for what it was at 1 hour & 48 minutes (108 minutes) without credits & the pacing, jeez... don't get me started.The actors were alright, but what they were given script wise, didn't work & made them come across as flat. There's some action & not bad effects to be had, but that's pretty much the only redeeming features from this flick, sadly. It hasn't a lot going for it & is pretty lack luster & basic.Don't get me wrong, I prefer films with straight forward story-lines & plots you can follow, but this one was a bit too basic & could've used more meatiness to beef it up more as well as more emphasis to keep the audience engaged with the story, characters, action etc.I generally didn't like the film & the ending is just out there too & is pretty cringy like some of the scenes in the film as well as the few cringy action sequences themselves among some of the good action we got.Overall, it's a bad film. And no, it's got nothing to do with the old chestnut of me being a man who doesn't like the film because it's female lead. The film was bad & had plenty of things wrong with it. People in general, men & women, boys & girls, didn't like this flick.The story is bland, boring & paper thin like the characters & leads, the little bit of good action & effects seen are overshadowed by the aforementioned issues as well as the other issues like the poor runtime, pacing & the lacking engagement the film has.Also, for those who can't seem to get it in their heads, there's been plenty of female lead films in the past that have done well, from the Alien Franchise to The Hunger Games along with Elektra, Tomb Raider, Salt, Lucy, Hanna etc. I could go on but that's my rant for those who need calling out.2/10.","2","20 February 2024"
"izadyardariush","I could tell from the beginning, making this movie was a bad idea. After I saw the cast I could tell this movie doomed. I have nothing against any of those actors but I must say casting a Dakota was a biggest mistake for the role! Anyone read the comics could say that. This movie was like terminator meeting final destination! No good story, big mess, lot of waste of potentials. I must say worst choice of villain!

"alindsayal","With Marvel Studios taking on more responsibility involving Spider-Man, Sony have decided to try and build a universe involving smaller characters from the same lore as him. We have had Venom and Morbius and will get Kraven The Hunter later this year but here we have Madame Web. I saw this film last night and here is my review for Madame Web. The p[remise of the film sees a women bestowed with powers where she has to save 3 girls from being killed by a villainous foe.Main Character
I must be honest that I have never been a huge fan of Dakota Johnson and she plays Cassandra Web here and I have to be honest she isn't particularly good here. She is overacting everything here and her character is super unlikeable and hard to care about. She is clearly hampered by the awful writing in this film and she can't rise above it and give us a lead role to support or care about and Cassie Web will go down as one of the worst leads in a comic book film ever.Supporting Characters
Sydney Sweeney, Isabela Merced & Celeste O'Connor play the three girls that are in the view of the villain and they are all pretty awful. Their characters are really awkward and not particularly likeable, the film tries to force you to like and care about these characters but it comes across poorly and these actresses aren't good enough to make me care.Tahar Rahim plays Ezekiel Sims and he is one of the more frustrating parts of this film because I have seen him be a good actor and this character had some potential but the film really flops here and makes him this over the top villain that is so stupid that it really takes you out of the film.Adam Scott as Ben Parker is probably the best person here but he isn't really given much to do and it still upsets me that he plays Ben Parker and it is really clear that this was just done to provide some stupid fan service that actually annoys me even more.Story
The story is nonsensical and completely stupid. The plot makes no sense and characters do things that make no sense, Cassie Web in particular is one of the dumbest characters that I have seen in recent movies. This film also tries its best to ruin the character of Spider-Man even though he isn't in the film and it is just the backdrop to this pretty dull and horrendous adventure.Script
This is a really awfully written film. Things make no sense, characters are unlikeable and there is no humour here at all. There are so many plot holes it is crazy and the film has nothing interesting about it at all.Style
I mean I guess the action scenes are okay and the bad guys suit was okay but that is it. The film is filmed really poorly, the editing looks unfinished and at times it is actually quite jarring to watch it. There are way too many jump scares especially for a film that is not a horror film. The trailer shows things that barely happen in the film and it feels like we were sold a different film that never got made.Overall
Overall, Madame Web is a truly disastrous film. This is up there with one of the worst films I have ever seen and is up there with the worst comic book films of all time. Though I am glad I saw this film to have this experience but at all cost avoid this garbage and do something better for 2 hours.Rating - 1/10.","1","16 February 2024"
"daisukereds","A baby-sitting movie in a Superhero setting, where the lead can see the future and has to prevent NOT-Spiderman from killing teenagers (because he has dreams/visions about them). The girls run and hide around a lot, some BS happens and then the movie ends.The foundation of the script is heavily written around a hollow core of ""parents and children"". The cinematography is actually good, and at least ""teaches"" how to do CPR. It also does away with showing premonitions every time something is to be changed near the end.. respecting the viewers intelligence in at least that aspect! And it's easy to follow (if you don't fall asleep) with how simplistic it is.Aside from that, it is barely anything else..
The movie itself isn't terrible.. it's just beyond bland and boring. Also, calling this a Superhero movie is really disingenuous and a marketing ploy to get people to see it. Stay home! There are no good action sequences and nobody is written memorably....
Venom making money was a mistake. Sony has half a franchise, and they can't get anyone talented enough to do something with it. And what they continue to release seems like high-budgeted fan fiction!","3","16 February 2024"
"isaacsundaralingam","Yea, this was garbage and that's saying plenty. It's actually adorable how little anyone cared about ""Madame Web"" - not just the audience, but the filmmakers and actors themselves. Written by the same people who wrote ""Morbius"", this movie is yet another reason to not let them anywhere near a writing software ever again.Not only was the movie unwatchable due to how lifeless it was, but it was also criminally boring. You're waiting for something to happen and you keep waiting right until the credits start to roll. Nothing about the movie was compelling, the plot was riddled with plot holes, the screenplay was lazy, the dialogues were dead and the acting was almost as if the actors were held captive and being forced to act as if everything was okay. It reeks of corporate greed and there isn't a single positive thing to say about this movie.We're only a month and half into the year and we already have a very strong contender for what might be the worst movie of the year, and it's not even close. Don't watch it, but if you do indeed decide to, I hope you lived a life well enough to have a crowded funeral.","1","19 February 2024"
"syntory","Look at the profiles for the writers that wrote Madame Web. You'll see virtually every movie they've written has a bad rating and bad reviews. Why then does Hollywood continually hire these same writers for these big budget films? I could understand if they wrote movies for Asylum Films because all their movies are terrible.Madame Web is god awful! Very difficult to sit through. None of the main characters are likeable. Even the villain is lame. It seems like the entire movie was written to set up a sequel. But why would people spend money to see the sequel of a movie that is one of the worst movies ever written? I'm shocked at how bad this movie is and if there is a sequel I certainly wont bother watching it.Stop hiring bad writers, Hollywood!","2","15 February 2024"
"MovieWarfare","I would absolutely love to be in these Sony meetings because I am absolutely baffled how things like Madame Web are getting greenlit.Madame Web is one of the worst superhero movies ever made! It has terrible writing, characters, action setpieces and even acting. Dakota Johnson is so dull and boring as the main lead but this is probably down to the terrible script.To be fair, the movie does have an interesting concept with this Final Destination x Terminator thing. However, it is so poorly executed that it makes Morbius look like The Dark Knight.Anyway give me the ""He Was in the Amazon With My Mom When She Was Researching Spiders Right Before She Died"" cut!","1","17 February 2024"
"chenp-54708","Literally one of the worst superhero movies I have ever seen.From the advertisements, I knew this movie wasn't going to be great but still, it surprised me how bad and boring it was. Everything about the direction, writing, characters, technical aspects, and designs are really awful. The writing is poor as there are many concepts, ideas and aspects that are messy and bland. The messy script creates poor dialogue from the cast and the characters are not interesting. The special effects looked even worse than the marketing and all of the performances were pretty bad. I honestly do feel bad for Dakota Johnson cause she is a good actress but she deserves to have better roles then this. It can be said for the same for the rest of the cast members.The uses of product placements are annoying, action moments are dull, and and all in all, it was boring. Superhero movies shouldn't be boring but this really dragged on. It's unfortunate cause female superhero leads are something I love to see more like Wonder Woman and The Old Guard which are pretty fun. But unfortunately, it seemed that it likely isn't going to happen anytime soon.There really isn't anything else to say.Bad.","1","14 February 2024"
"AlsExGal","... when I saw Dakota Johnson was starring in it. Naturally I can't lay the entirety of this hot mess at her feet. But there is some really bad campy acting happening on her part, reminiscent of the Fifty Shades of Grey movies in which she starred. Perhaps it was because the director was more interested in the placement of Pepsi cans than her performance, but I digress.Basically, this movie plays out like the cut scenes from a budget Xbox 360 game. From the ground up this thing just feels designed to fail. It feels almost Producersesque in its approach in just how every aspect is seemingly intentionally mangled, yet no one seems to care. How have we come so full circle to go through the glory of Infinity War/Logan/The Dark Knight to arrive all the way back to Batman and Robin and Catwoman levels of superhero flicks? (Bam!, Pow!, Gosh yes Batman!)How did this movie make it so far that it has an actual release, and no one stopped it? How did this idea get green lit? Why did Sony give 80 million and turn over their valuable IP to the people that wrote Morbius, Gods of Egypt, Dracula Untold and The Last Witch Hunter? How did this get past the writing process and again have that script greenlit? How could no one on the set at any point stop things? How did no one in the editing room point out how bad it looked and how much of a mess it was?But to the suits it's not about art and story. Instead it's about business, and people are just a commodity. It's cheaper to recycle known quantities, and practice nepotism and involve maybe less than talented friends, people you've worked with before, than go out and find artists with worthy stories. They don't care about art, they don't care about stories, they care about making this work for them financially, regardless of loss of reputation with audiences as a whole.Youtuber Chris Stuckmann did a deep dive on the topic of big studios being generally run by folks who came up through management rather than the creative rungs such as writing and directing when he discussed this film. His take is worth watching. For some reason, Chris doesn't do critical movie reviews since he has become a filmmaker, but I can tell by his tone that, like me, he was completely displeased watching this one. I'd avoid it.","2","17 February 2024"
"eoinageary","This is, well I guess this is a movie in the Sony universe that I'm SHOCKED is profitable.The story is all over the place, it's basically about Madame Web who is a paramedic and develops powers and can see into the future, with a current threat she tries to change the future, teaming up with 3 powerful characters who are yet to develop into their full potential so she must shield them and change the future to protect them.Trying not to give the little story that gets told away in the opening there but i have to be vague.What I liked, one or two good scenes, I didn't mind the end, I really liked a lot of the camera work some cool looking shots and a decent Score.But the movie is BAD, it makes Morbius look like The Batman 2022. The acting is lacking, the actors look as bored as you will feel. Script is bad, just some beyond silly lines, the story chops and changes so much your neck will hurt you, some bad CGI, and just boring action.And before people harp on about ""you don't like it because it's women leads"" no, it's just a crap film, I enjoyed the marvels, Black Widow was decent, so no, the movie regardless of its leads is just poor.Extremely disappointing, 3/10.","3","14 February 2024"

"hotrobinproductions","Horrible from beginning to end, the opening scene just reeks of awful predictability from story & plot to the core. You know exactly what will happen before it even happens, the script sucks & the dialogue is even worse. There is quite noticeable audio dub edited after the fact too. This budget is 80 million, not that budget matters, because no amount of money could have saved this train wreck, but I mention this because you can still make a good film on lower budgets, Shazam, the first one, had the same budget & delt with a lot of side characters too, it's miles better, Godzilla minus one had a extremely low budget too. But this 80 million dollar film not just effects but production, feels obviously cheap, it almost feels like watching a very long pilot episode to a CW tv show.You thought Morbius was bad, that film was bad because it did the bare minimum, this film doesn't even do the bare minimum, it goes beyond comprehension below that, it just enters a point of no originality or ambition towards creating anything. There isn't even a single superhero moment, even horrible films like catwoman or Morbius has superhero moments & action, this thing doesn't, you get instead visions of the future to potentially set up sequels.This movie also has a serious problem of product placement, it's a long commercial, to be exact a long Pepsi commercial, I feel like Pepsi stopped the halftime show so they could invest in the product placement in this film. This movie was more important to them than the superbowl LOL it's just so over the top & obviously placed way too much in this film. Calvin Klein, Chase bank, the list goes on. This movie should be called superhero product placement the movie.It's barely even close to a 1/10 the cool moments are seeing what we already saw in the trailer when she's seeing the future & you think it's happening now but then it goes back to the moment she realizes it's a vision, granted it's cool the first couple times but it gets old REAL quick. & it ends up getting annoying because it's abused way too much.Thats about it, there isn't any redeeming things in this film, the acting isn't even good. I would say the 3 side character spider women that Dakota finds when they are together there was a potential spark. I saw the talent & potential, but they are failed big time by such a horrid script that the spark never even sparks, it's just like showing you the matches & gasoline & not setting the fire.Madame M0RBIUS / 10.","1","16 February 2024"
"olcare","It's the worst movie and superhero adaptation I've watched in recent years. Completely atrocious effects, atrocious screenplay, and atrocious acting. Also, a big insult to all comic book readers and those who know the original story.Let me describe the movie simply. First of all, I am filled with hatred; I really want to curse the entire creative team for this unacceptable film.All the performances are bad, everyone. There's not a single good actor trying; everyone just took the role for money. It's a terrible disgrace, a total eclipse of reason.The screenplay is the worst superhero screenplay I've ever seen. It barely resembles the original story, and if there aren't scenes like the other Spider-Girls in the trailer, why include them? There's no such obligation; instead, write a decent screenplay. All action scenes are full of logical errors; they've written it without thinking, it's complete garbage.Apart from these, the direction, sorry to say, is garbage too. Most scenes are shot as if they were taken straight from a phone camera; action scenes are not shown, they're hidden due to the atrociousness of the effects. It's shameful.After these general points, Sony urgently needs to cancel this universe; the original stories are garbage, there's no logic, no connection anywhere. They're just being shot randomly. I don't like to curse, but I hope this film sinks at the box office.The last scene with Madame Web gaining her powers, those web effects, clinging to souls, it's unbelievable how you approved this film, may God punish you.I don't know which one to talk about; all the atrocities are collected in this film. Whether it's the woman going to Peru and back in 30 seconds, Spider-Man dodging with fireworks, dancing at the boys' table when my daughters are left alone, not telling the story of the Spider-Human community, or the woman talking normally while giving birth at the end, everything is a disgrace. I hope this universe sinks, and you all get fired. No one involved in the management of this film deserves their job respectfully; they should quit immediately.Note: Dakota Johnson made a statement saying she didn't watch the movie. Why are you serving a completely garbage film if you're not going to watch it? Life shouldn't be all about money for you; we, in our poverty, are trying to watch it, and this is no different from cursing all the audience's families. Shame on you.Note 2: Just now, I looked at the budget of the movie, and my anger grew even more, 80 million dollars EIGHTY MILLION. How can I not believe this money, I really can't believe it, it's nothing but disrespect to yourself, disrespect to the audience, nothing but an insult.","1","16 February 2024"
"sinscopefilms","First Impression:The opening of the Madame Web was immersed in a mystique and ambition, enhanced by great musical score; yet, as the movie progresses, it becomes a mixed bag and a rollercoaster of emotions.The Positive:Musical Score and Sound Design: The standout feature of ""Madame Web"" is its musical score. The soundtrack not only enhances the emotional depth of the film but also succeeds in creating in some moments genuine goosebumps. The sound design really enhances this impact by carefully using sound pans, bass, and reverse effects. It creates a sense of tension and immersion which is one of the film's strongest features.The Mixed:Visual Effects and Costume Design: Some of the visual effects in ""Madame Web"" were visually appealing. The costume design, like Casey's red jacket and the three spider girl villain outfits standing out as particularly stunning contributions to the film's aesthetic, but it was not often shown in the film since the films direction and focus was different. I was disappointed.Acting and Direction: Although I thought Casey's character development - her ability to see the world from a different perspective - was great, I didn't like how it was visually presented. The way it was edited was poorly done. The editor could use 2 distinct color grading features where one sees the future and two, she sees the present moment.However, The performances throughout the film feel lackluster, with the actors appearing confused and disengaged. This, combined with direction that fails to maintain interest or coherence in many scenes, significantly undermines the film's potential.Negatives:Cinematography: Cinematography is bad since some pictures don't show a clear image. The camera moves so fast that I cannot comprehend the picture. I kind of recognized that it tries to initiate the rapidness of the events from the spider's eye point of view but it was a tasteless decision. The Cinematography is not something like wow. The reason why Cinematography was lacking is because it was heavily based on medium closeups and dutch tilts which on one hand was a unique choice but on the other hand very hard to watch. I found the 180 degree round camera rotations super cool, but again, I expected varied distance shots, not just medium shots. The train scene Cinematography was the best in the film.Editing and Pace: The editing is arguably the weakest element of ""Madame Web,"" with its rapid cuts and disjointed flow detracting significantly from the storytelling. This lack of coherence makes it challenging for the audience to fully engage with the narrative.Plot and Overall Execution: The storyline of ""Madame Web"" is cluttered and clichéd, suffering from a lack of originality and clear direction. The film's ambition is evident, but the execution falls short of creating a compelling narrative.The Conclusion:""Madame Web"" presents a paradoxical experience, with exceptional music and sound design standing that sharply contrasts with its various flaws in editing, cinematography, and direction.Although there are some visually and emotionally stunning moments, they are frequently overshadowed by a lack of coherence and clarity.Also, I think this film would be reasonable and great to be incorporated in a TV series which would have allowed for a more in-depth exploration of characters and plot.Nevertheless, Madame Web is a bit of a mixed bag, with moments of potential that ultimately leave the viewer something different visually.Rating: 3/10.","3","15 February 2024"
"Skruffbagg","Cannon, is that you in disguise?I firmly believe Madame Web will go down in history as not only the worst superhero movie, but also one of the worst movies ever made. It's that bad. It's absolutely fascinating to behold.Now, I'll be honest with you here. I only went to see this because I had heard it was an unmitigated disaster that had to be seen to be believed, and it truly does not disappoint - or massively does, depending on your viewpoint.It takes a special kind of director to get such cringe-inducing performances out of a fairly talented cast (Dakota Johnson and Tahar Rahim are both quality actors with the right script and direction), but SJ Clarkson somehow manages to wrangle the absolute worst imaginable from every single person in the film. I'll be very surprised if she ever does another feature after this.Nothing in this film works; the plot is moronic, the script seems like it was written by a teenager, the cinematography is horrendous, the aformentioned embarrassing performances, the audio editing is baffling (so much dubbing, brain-melting music choices). I'm amazed this didn't get shelved the minute the final cut was done.To me, I rate this as ""so bad it's good"" as I wasn't bored watching it, but most people I assume will say it's just plain bad... and it is, but very entertainingly so.If you love watching a 2hr car crash then I highly recommend this. The awfulness is mind-boggling in it's complexity, but in the best possible way. Film scholars and historians will be analysing this movie for years to come, and I hope it is talked about in the same vein as The Room in the future.An absolutely epic misfire on all levels.","1","20 February 2024"
"MiroslavKyuranov","It's astonishing to think that Sony could put out a worse product than 2022's Morbius, but boy, ""Madame Web"" manages it. It is an embarrassing mess. Talented stars wasted on probably one of the worst comic book movie ever (which nobody asked for). Filled with atrocious dialogue, awkward editing and laughable structure. It's a clunky, poorly-written, messy, and sloppy movie packed with some mediocre editing and performances.The concept is interesting on paper, but it couldn't be saved due to it's terrible execution. ""Madame Web"" simply lacked the spark it needed in nearly every dept.There is simply nothing memorable in this movie, except maybe some superhero costumes, but that doesn't redeem the fact that the movie is bad.So yeah...""Madame Web"" is yet another disappointing entry in the Sony's Spider-Less universe. It's like a love letter to an era of superhero films that people largely want to forget. The ""Pepsi"" adds are stand-out, it falls short of what could have been a decent movie in the hands of someone else twenty years ago.","4","14 February 2024"
"darrelltill","There is nothing good in this film. It's badly written - not just full of clichés but full of dialogue that is meant to sound like cliché superhero idioms yet butchered until they make no sense. It is nothing but a costume parade with players that are dead behind the eyes. You can tell that everybody involved knows it's going to be a stinker but they'd already signed on and it was too late. It would be great if this was the flop that made Disney rethink their output (I know, this is actually an SSU movie not an MCU movie, but they are all heading down the same path) but I fear it will take a few more. The solution is really simple - they need to adjust their hiring policy to include persons of talent.","1","15 February 2024"
"movieman6-413-929510","Madame Web is a new spin-off set in the Marvel Spider-Man world. This spin-off is directed, partly written and produced by S. J. Clarkson. Before this film, she directed more TV series episodes of superhero shows such as Jessica Jones and The Defenders.Cassandra Webb (Dakota Johnson) works as a paramedic in New York and learns after an accident that she has superpowers to see future possibilities. She sees that the lives of three girls are threatened by a mysterious masked man with spider-like powers.This is why she tries to protect the three girls and must convince them that their lives are really in danger. To truly protect them, they must ensure that the three listen to her and learn to work together.The story of this film has an interesting concept, but the final story and screenplay were written by five different writers. These writers do not always seem to have been on the same page, because the story sometimes seems a bit rushed or frayed. It sometimes seems as if they didn't really know what exactly to do with it, or what the film studio despised of them. The screenplay has also been rewritten many times, so the cast members could no longer always follow exactly where they were going or supposed to do with the film.Despite these messy, rushed aspects, the film remains on a familiar, predictable side for a superhero film. This can make the film seem a bit long-winded or embarrassing. The film is reminiscent of other superhero films that came out around the year 2000, but of a somewhat lesser quality.The visual effects don't always look believable either. The blue screen and CGI can be seen in the film. For some of the cast members, this was also the first time they had actually worked in a film with such visual effects. The fact that they have little or no experience with these film situations is sometimes reflected in their acting.The poor script also gives the cast members few opportunities to make something special of their roles. Dakota Johnson also seemed a bit uncomfortable during promotions of the film, or ignorant of how to properly promote this film. In the final film she tries to make the best of the role and tries to add some comedy to the role, but she doesn't always get the chance to do this. Sydney Sweeney, Isabela Merced and Celeste O'Connor play the three girls Cassandra tries to protect. All three are given a little time to give their characters some personalities, but unfortunately not enough to make you as a viewer really care about the three. For a better focused film, they might have been better off using a character in the story, who Cassandra then has to protect. Tahar Rahim plays the villain in the film, who tries to kill the three girls, but also deals with the poor, weak script. As a result, he does not emerge as strongly as the villain of the story. They also didn't incorporate his audio work well into the film, because his lips sometimes don't always match what his character is saying.With all these superhero spin-off films from the Sony film studio, they only make Marvel's current film series more messy. If Sony and Disney Marvel try to collaborate on the same film series, they will have to consult each other more and better and plan where they want to go with this film series.","2","17 February 2024"
"ethanbresnett","Based on Madame Web's woeful reviews I was expecting this film to be an utter car crash. To its credit I will say it isn't entirely without merit, but it is incredibly boring and bland.Mostly this is because nothing particularly happens. It's a superhero movie with little to no superhero action and a painfully long set up for an underwhelming final act. The characters are so underdeveloped that there is no emotional connection or investment in any of them. Everything about the story and writing just feels lazy, vacuous and corny.Then there's the villain who is utterly uninspiring. He is constantly complaining about 'everything he has built' being destroyed. What has he built you might ask? The film has no interest in exploring this question. He's easily one of the more two dimensional and weak superhero villains I've ever seen committed to screen.Perhaps the most heinous crime this movie commits is to waste the talents of Dakota Johnson, Sydney Sweeney, Adam Scott, Emma Roberts, Zosia Mamet and more. Such a good cast was assembled and they were given absolutely nothing to work with, so I don't blame the performers. It's just such a shame to see such great talent put to the sword like this.As if all of this wasn't enough, the movie also feels remarkably low budget and feels excruciatingly long despite its relatively short runtime.Ultimately I think this film suffered because it was clearly intended as a set up for a wider Spider-Woman franchise which is unlikely to come to fruition. There seemed to be no interest in making a good stand alone movie, and no respect for the audience. A massive waste of time.","3","21 February 2024"
"vfphvnpp","I understand what the plan was here. They wanted a trippy film, focusing on a strong future for the Sony verse. The problem is the delivery. The camera work in this movie made it quite irritating to follow, as there was constant quick close up shots of the action. The dialogue was awful, and there was quite a lot of blatant voice over during the villain scenes.So much wasted time was given to boring scenes in the movie, which led me to believe the screen writers finished the script and realised that it was under the word count.Honestly the acting quality was quite poor across the board, especially the villain, who honestly seems as if they didn't cast for his role at all, just picked up someone off the side of the road.For someone who's guilty pleasure is watching bad movies, I it was a painful time. Don't recommend.","2","14 February 2024"
"jtorch-11283","Don't waste your time, and money seeing this in theaters. I was fooled by the trailer which looked promising. All the action in the whole film ( a total of 2 scenes) is shown in the the trailer. The rest of the movie is just terrible acting trying to save an even worse scrip.I'm honestly not sure how this made it to the big screen. I'm not a cinema expert, but shouldn't someone have to view the finished product and give the O. K. At some point before it is ""audience ready?"" I feel like that step in the process was skipped. I don't know what Marvel had to do with this film, but it certainly isn't the Iron-Man-Marvel I keep hoping they will somehow revive.And to whom it may concern, ""my parents don't love me."" Is neither a solid backstory OR a strong character trait. I hope you eat a lot of money on this movie.","1","15 February 2024"
"cosby_don","I don't know where to start-actually, I do! THIS IS THE WORST MOVIE IN THE HISTORY OF HUMANITY. I'm not kidding.I'm not sure what other movie this Dakota Johnson has been in, but after watching THIS movie, I'll probably never support her again. This was an absolute career killer. Ms. Johnson, please FIRE your agent immediately.To the production crew, editors, director, and ESPECIALLY the writers (I counted 4 writers-that's RIDICULOUS), shame on you for contributing to this mess. It's obvious you've traded in your morals for a paycheck. That's Hollywood for ya'.Did I mention that this movie was HORRENDOUSLY bad? Everything about this movie was bad-there are ZERO redeeming qualities.The story: STUPID. Worst I've ever seen, seriously. Madam Web ask the girls to wait for 3 hours in the woods? STUPID. The guy partner keeping the girls as Madam Web flies to Peru to check something out. STUPID. Madam a Web getting her powers from a spider bite through her mother. STUPID. I could seriously go on and on. I'm not kidding-EVERYTHING in this movie was STUPID. I can't count how many times I shook my head and said ""This is so bad.""The acting? Very wooden. Ms. Dakota Johnson's acting chops were the worst of the worst here. I really pray that she's done work much better. The other girls-they tried. Jokes fell flat, and they said the DUMBEST lines ever in a movie. I was seriously angry at how dumb they were.The villain? The most generic, uninteresting, uncool villain over ever seen on film. Not one memorable quote. Come to think, did he even make a ""evil guy"" speech? Nope!The ending? Oh my, HORRENDOUS. She's smiling in her glasses while paralyzed in a wheel chair? MAN WHI WROTE THIS MESS??The girls weren't even in costume more than 2 minutes of the entire film, even though in the trailer we came to expect them to be crime fighters and kicking butt in the film.

"rgkarim","LIKES:The Commentary At Times
-Some lines in this movie are startling at how funny they were for me, a fantastic bout of teenage emotions with a less than thrilled babysitter.-Madame Web's origin story is almost like an anti-hero tale to Charles Xavier idea, and though it's not fully fleshed out, there is emotion, fun, and what felt natural angst and vulnerability into it.-With the right timing, and build up, this section of commentary was a striking positive in this reviewers book.Representation of Paramedics
-It's a rare thing to get to actually see E. M. T's in their work and what they give to serve the public.-While a bit forced, and perhaps a tad overdone and cheesy, kudos for Madame Web accomplishing some detailed shots of them serving the public and giving a little character development with it.-There were great avenues taken to help ingrain parts into the story, and with that, the medical nerd inside me found a cool little nod in those sequences.Some Artistic Visuals Are Cool
-I'm a sucker for a good shot and a good artistic visual popping out and ingraining itself into my mind.-Madame Web has some of these moments for me, the creepy and yet serene world of the Web World, being one that holds majesty and mystery, but also the very emotions of the person trying to wield it.-Other shots of costume crusaders striking that right pose, or perhaps that nostalgic early 2000s look, really help establish some of the themes of the movie or a good set up visual to cascade into.-It may be sprinkled about, but there were some superhero visuals that accomplished the job for me in Madame Web.Talented Cast
-Celeste O'Connor is very fun in this movie. A tad quirky, but she keeps the attitude going, a lot of that sass very fun and usually well-placed to help move the story towards forced comedy and obvious story telling.-Merced eventually grew on me after she got into the meat of her character and starting to push past the stubborn and cheeky attitude. She's got charming charisma, a fun brainy side to exploit, and this sadness that she uses to illicit such emotion, something I wanted more of, but got only little.-Sweeney is fun in this movie. Toned down from the other roles I've seen, the woman knows how to adapt her style and give me something to hook to several times. I love the awkwardness she brings, the tie in to the two extremes, and her surprising smallness after she plays such big roles.-And Johnson is about the same as she always is. A snarky and condescending nature that she wields expertly, but a tad dry at times that some lines feel unfulfilled. Fortunately, she's got good chemistry with the girls that assisted in smoothing out the faults.Some Surprising Character Arcs
-The movie may miss a lot of things, but there are a few moments that work very well to show the potential of Madame Web if given the right focus.-An opening that holds some merit was one of the victories, something that would eventually bleed into plot points further on that gave you a very touching moment.-And another element has the other's origin stories granting us some potential hurt and relatable tales to latch onto and acknowledge. Again, helping give a young and in your face Charlie's Angel group some vim and vigor.The Music
-Call me a sucker for nostalgia, Madame Web has a mix of songs that were perfect for viewers like me to enjoy.-Comedic use of the songs are not the most creative, but add that minor element to help give the girls a little more dynamic and believability.-While other times, it's just a blast of the speakers and me dancing in my seat as the forgotten wonder returns for another run to get things started.DISLIKES:The Pacing Uneven
-Despite the trinkets and some merits to the story, Madame Web's dislikes for me start with the pacing of the tale.-A moderately slow start did little to keep me engaged, only to then have these sprints of faster moments to try to change things up, before hitting the brakes again.-Like a CW season crammed into one, Madame Web's pacing feels a lot like dressed up teenage drama trying to give realism and gradual steps, but really just being the mashup of the uglier time use dramas can get stuck to.The Stale Mechanic
-From the trailers, you know there is some type of vision gimmick that Cassie is supposed to use to protect her charges.-That gimmick gets stale very quickly for a viewer like me, the convoluted presentation starting out fun at first, but then turning into annoying déjà vu that felt more like reshoots than actual artistic twisting.-Like Moon Knight, that element makes sense at first, but really could have stopped halfway through the movie once the viewers has connected the powers.-Had there been a bit more excitement, fighting, or even better storytelling to distract, it would have been less impactful, but alas, for me, all the other limitations added up.Lack of Other Character Development
-There are a lot of characters in this movie, some played by bigger names than the leads themselves. And yet, their time and character development felt shoehorned than planned out.-Adam Scott and Emma Roberts seem disengaged, with stories that are cliché, simplistic, and a waste of talent that again showed potential with that slower pacing at the start.-But even the villain and main girls tales feel very bland, and that lack of character development was very much felt by me that it almost seems to rely heavily on another movie to do these characters justice.Annoying Dialogue
-I know, I said the commentary was good, but that was a small amount of it compared to the whole.-Madame Web's dialogue seems to have gone through the writing grinder several times, very loaded with one liners, sassy comments and attitude that seemed to be out of place for much of the film for me.-Statements of the obvious, corny dialogue essentially pushed in with too simplistic of writing and in your face, overdramatic flair to count as quality dialogue. It needs tuning up, needs to be less forceful, and try to add a little Hollywood magic to help tenderize it to something matching a comic book movie.A Villain Needing A Lot More
-Don't get me wrong, there is an element to him that is relatable, believable, and indeed threatening in terms of the madness of his actions.-But outside of this and the opening scene, Ezekiel is a very bland bad guy who just didn't get the time to shine outside of crawling and repeating the same lines over and over.-The direction failed to give him any recognizable skills, his threats empty most of the time and sort of creepy obsessive, and dare I say his actual character is zoomed over and practically absent but for the opening line.-To me, that's a limited villain and one major flaw that much of the movie suffers from.Visuals Get Really Muddy/Bad
-Sony makes such great looking video games, and yet their movies still suffer from last gen effects
-While the artistic flair of those moments was enjoyable, they did have that faux effect that dropped some of the realism this movie was going for.-Even worse, there are lots of movements, character renderings, and powers that leave a lot to be desired in looking their best. I won't say it's a dealbreaker, but it doesn't help to have such limited technology presentation.Scenes/Story Seem Very Chopped Up
-Between the gimmicks and pacing, the scenes already feel limited, messy, and almost like an abbreviated version of what they could be.-Sure, the dialogue gives you everything they are going for, but the presentation felt very much like a lot of reshoots of the same scene, and slight changes that made little difference.-Such indecisive direction and edits got away from them and left me just wondering what this film could have been with half the gimmicks of the visions pulled back.The Action Is Very Boring
-No denying this, Madame Web maybe even worse than many of the CW attempts at action.-While witty, and an amusing game of cat and mouse, a Spiderverse without a solid one or two fights is a verse I'm not fond playing in for nearly two hours.-A lame villain does little but strut and crawl, while our cast somehow running away and eluding comes off a bit pathetic than entertaining.-Even the climax is a mess, rushed finishes, suspense of disbelief, and an overdramatic battle of words with a very extravagant and mushy ending to cap it off.-Eternals at least had a few moves that had me rocking in my seat, but this... this was a challenge to stay awake in.The VERDICT:
Madame Web is certainly not the worst movie I've seen in years, but that doesn't mean Sony's latest is a masterpiece either. There are elements of this vision that show the potential for a good future, but need a lot of work to make up for this rushed installment. A talented cast, music and some fun writing can be the starting building blocks, but it can't offset what feels like lots of production limitations, rewrites, and editing that greatly show in this movie. Boring battles, annoying gimmicks, and under developed characters despite a strong cast were just some of the limitations this movie has to work through if a series is to come with it. Should one see it in theaters? Not really. A shot at home, I would say sure, but with all of this, my scores for the movie are:Action/Adventure/Sci-Fi: 6.0
Movie Overall: 5.0.","5","15 February 2024"
"eddie_baggins","I'm not ashamed to admit I've seen some movies in my time.I am however ashamed to admit curiosity got the better of me and I ended up in an almost entirely empty cinema screening (thanks to one tolerant movie buddy who joined me on my trip to the local cinema) partaking in what can only be described as one of the most universally panned Hollywood blockbusters of the modern era.Not at all interested in watching another Sony Marvel outing after their last few efforts, hearing about the insanely awesome awfulness of Madame Web from friends, internet identities and esteemed critics made me want to witness a potential all-time cringe-fest and while when people are absolutely right in their hyperbole around just how bad Madame Web is, I'm still trying to comprehend how I could possibly testify to just how bad things are here.Directed by long time TV episode director S. J. Clarkson and featuring a cast of performers who have all proven over time to be more than capable of bringing the goods, Madame Web is not devoid of talent that may have been able to salvage some type of goodness from an offence against the entire cinematic medium but as a finished? (Honestly I am unsure how anyone could claim this is an acceptable final version, just watch for some of the most flawed examples of ADR you're ever going to see) product there was no one or any thing that could've saved this nightmare from the fate it had created for itself.An experience that could only possibly come from a collective group who all gave up the fight to save it long before shooting had wrapped, Madame Web inexcusably comes from the same penmanship that was guilty of unleashing Morbius on us but screenwriters Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless at least managed to find some cult like goodness in Jared Leto and Matt Smith's wildly OTT characters and bizarre action segments but Madame Web is nothing more than two hours of terrible plot, characters, spectacle and intentions and there is quite literally no valid reason for this movie to exist in the form it has been given.One of the most atrociously acted Hollywood films ever captured, with lead Dakota Johnson unable to hold back her disdain for a film she clearly hated being a part of and poor old Tahar Rahim taking the films most unfortunate mantle from a wigged Sydney Sweeney, Madame Web may have been promoted as some type of intense action thriller following the exploits of Johnson's Cassandra Webb as she battles Rahim's Ezekiel Sims alongside Sweeney's Julia, Isabela Merced's Anya and Celeste O'Connor's Mattie but we get something else entirely that is hard to come to terms with.From some of the most detestable and frequent examples of product placement that becomes instantly iconic (some viewers may find themselves attempting to crack open a Pepsi can in their Calvin Klein's after a viewing), a villain we literally know nothing about with zero attempts to bother explaining his plans or background, an embarrassing use of comic staple characters that aren't even put into action outside of dream sequences and a script that must surely have been conjured on ChatGPT, Madame Web is a cesspool of Hollywood excrement that isn't even funny in its horribleness, just merely sad and depressing.The only justifiable reason for Madame Web to be the film it is as it stands is if Sony are deliberately attempting to sabotage their Marvel property that no longer is allowed to include many fan favourites, if they aren't in fact doing that there is zero excuses for why Madame Web has ever been allowed to be birthed into existence.An irredeemable, amateurish and embarrassing exercise in pointless, Madame Web is a shockingly bad example of blockbuster filmmaking that is the exact type of bottom feeder product the cinema industry and the Marvel brand didn't need at this particular point of time.Final Say -If you're a glutton for punishment and want to be reminded of everything you wouldn't wish to see in a supposed piece of big screen entertainment then Madame Web is for you! A truly iconic new addition to the staples of all-time misfires, nothing could prepare one for the garbage that is this $80 million dollar disasterpiece.0 fireworks to the head out of 5.Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)","1","22 February 2024"
"shaikhirshad-41223","Literally I had zero expectations when I went to watch this flick but I still thought that something should be good in this to watch at least one time because of marvel name in it. But this movie is so low and looks like low budget CGI thriller and a comedy in the name of superhero genre.I mean from the start itself movie lost it's pace and story and god only knows what are they showing no interest in the screenplay and the plot is not even engaging to watch for at least 30 mins.I only went for Dakota & Sydney just because the screen presence of them looks good, but the director loss this opportunity too. Because the character they're playing is so bad and not even proper dialogues are given and just they have made a common character with no story arc just the situation that they have to act
I've never seen such a bad cinematography of any film it looks like they don't have any interest making this film so they just made a spoof just to show that we are making a movie.

"vengeance20","Ok, so before people come at me with the ""YoU dIdN't LiKe It BeCaUsE iT wAs FeMaLe LeAd."" chestnut. I went into this one with an open mind, but expecting it to be as described & the reviews were right. The film is bad.The film sees Cassandra Webb who is a New York metropolis paramedic who begins to demonstrate signs of clairvoyance. Forced to challenge revelations about her past, she needs to safeguard 3 young girls from a deadly adversary who wants them destroyed.I found the film to be pretty bad. It's disjointed, clunky, poorly paced & just feels very awkward & stiff. The characters are personality-less, they look & sound as if they're reciting their lines from cue cards (almost robotic, I might add) & the script reads like a supermarket shopping receipt.The films story is all over the place, confusing & hard to follow. The premonition sequences the main lead experiences were annoying & while creative, were repetitive to the point where you couldn't tell if she was hallucinating or actually seeing what she was seeing.The films runtime is overly long for what it is, while not as bad as other films which are generally over 2 hours (rolls eyes), this film felt longer & as I said was too long for what it was at 1 hour & 48 minutes (108 minutes) without credits & the pacing, jeez... don't get me started.The actors were alright, but what they were given script wise, didn't work & made them come across as flat. There's some action & not bad effects to be had, but that's pretty much the only redeeming features from this flick, sadly. It hasn't a lot going for it & is pretty lack luster & basic.Don't get me wrong, I prefer films with straight forward story-lines & plots you can follow, but this one was a bit too basic & could've used more meatiness to beef it up more as well as more emphasis to keep the audience engaged with the story, characters, action etc.I generally didn't like the film & the ending is just out there too & is pretty cringy like some of the scenes in the film as well as the few cringy action sequences themselves among some of the good action we got.Overall, it's a bad film. And no, it's got nothing to do with the old chestnut of me being a man who doesn't like the film because it's female lead. The film was bad & had plenty of things wrong with it. People in general, men & women, boys & girls, didn't like this flick.The story is bland, boring & paper thin like the characters & leads, the little bit of good action & effects seen are overshadowed by the aforementioned issues as well as the other issues like the poor runtime, pacing & the lacking engagement the film has.Also, for those who can't seem to get it in their heads, there's been plenty of female lead films in the past that have done well, from the Alien Franchise to The Hunger Games along with Elektra, Tomb Raider, Salt, Lucy, Hanna etc. I could go on but that's my rant for those who need calling out.2/10.","2","20 February 2024"

"alindsayal","With Marvel Studios taking on more responsibility involving Spider-Man, Sony have decided to try and build a universe involving smaller characters from the same lore as him. We have had Venom and Morbius and will get Kraven The Hunter later this year but here we have Madame Web. I saw this film last night and here is my review for Madame Web. The p[remise of the film sees a women bestowed with powers where she has to save 3 girls from being killed by a villainous foe.Main Character
I must be honest that I have never been a huge fan of Dakota Johnson and she plays Cassandra Web here and I have to be honest she isn't particularly good here. She is overacting everything here and her character is super unlikeable and hard to care about. She is clearly hampered by the awful writing in this film and she can't rise above it and give us a lead role to support or care about and Cassie Web will go down as one of the worst leads in a comic book film ever.Supporting Characters
Sydney Sweeney, Isabela Merced & Celeste O'Connor play the three girls that are in the view of the villain and they are all pretty awful. Their characters are really awkward and not particularly likeable, the film tries to force you to like and care about these characters but it comes across poorly and these actresses aren't good enough to make me care.Tahar Rahim plays Ezekiel Sims and he is one of the more frustrating parts of this film because I have seen him be a good actor and this character had some potential but the film really flops here and makes him this over the top villain that is so stupid that it really takes you out of the film.Adam Scott as Ben Parker is probably the best person here but he isn't really given much to do and it still upsets me that he plays Ben Parker and it is really clear that this was just done to provide some stupid fan service that actually annoys me even more.Story
The story is nonsensical and completely stupid. The plot makes no sense and characters do things that make no sense, Cassie Web in particular is one of the dumbest characters that I have seen in recent movies. This film also tries its best to ruin the character of Spider-Man even though he isn't in the film and it is just the backdrop to this pretty dull and horrendous adventure.Script
This is a really awfully written film. Things make no sense, characters are unlikeable and there is no humour here at all. There are so many plot holes it is crazy and the film has nothing interesting about it at all.Style
I mean I guess the action scenes are okay and the bad guys suit was okay but that is it. The film is filmed really poorly, the editing looks unfinished and at times it is actually quite jarring to watch it. There are way too many jump scares especially for a film that is not a horror film. The trailer shows things that barely happen in the film and it feels like we were sold a different film that never got made.Overall
Overall, Madame Web is a truly disastrous film. This is up there with one of the worst films I have ever seen and is up there with the worst comic book films of all time. Though I am glad I saw this film to have this experience but at all cost avoid this garbage and do something better for 2 hours.Rating - 1/10.","1","16 February 2024"
"daisukereds","A baby-sitting movie in a Superhero setting, where the lead can see the future and has to prevent NOT-Spiderman from killing teenagers (because he has dreams/visions about them). The girls run and hide around a lot, some BS happens and then the movie ends.The foundation of the script is heavily written around a hollow core of ""parents and children"". The cinematography is actually good, and at least ""teaches"" how to do CPR. It also does away with showing premonitions every time something is to be changed near the end.. respecting the viewers intelligence in at least that aspect! And it's easy to follow (if you don't fall asleep) with how simplistic it is.Aside from that, it is barely anything else..
The movie itself isn't terrible.. it's just beyond bland and boring. Also, calling this a Superhero movie is really disingenuous and a marketing ploy to get people to see it. Stay home! There are no good action sequences and nobody is written memorably....
Venom making money was a mistake. Sony has half a franchise, and they can't get anyone talented enough to do something with it. And what they continue to release seems like high-budgeted fan fiction!","3","16 February 2024"
"isaacsundaralingam","Yea, this was garbage and that's saying plenty. It's actually adorable how little anyone cared about ""Madame Web"" - not just the audience, but the filmmakers and actors themselves. Written by the same people who wrote ""Morbius"", this movie is yet another reason to not let them anywhere near a writing software ever again.Not only was the movie unwatchable due to how lifeless it was, but it was also criminally boring. You're waiting for something to happen and you keep waiting right until the credits start to roll. Nothing about the movie was compelling, the plot was riddled with plot holes, the screenplay was lazy, the dialogues were dead and the acting was almost as if the actors were held captive and being forced to act as if everything was okay. It reeks of corporate greed and there isn't a single positive thing to say about this movie.We're only a month and half into the year and we already have a very strong contender for what might be the worst movie of the year, and it's not even close. Don't watch it, but if you do indeed decide to, I hope you lived a life well enough to have a crowded funeral.","1","19 February 2024"
"syntory","Look at the profiles for the writers that wrote Madame Web. You'll see virtually every movie they've written has a bad rating and bad reviews. Why then does Hollywood continually hire these same writers for these big budget films? I could understand if they wrote movies for Asylum Films because all their movies are terrible.Madame Web is god awful! Very difficult to sit through. None of the main characters are likeable. Even the villain is lame. It seems like the entire movie was written to set up a sequel. But why would people spend money to see the sequel of a movie that is one of the worst movies ever written? I'm shocked at how bad this movie is and if there is a sequel I certainly wont bother watching it.Stop hiring bad writers, Hollywood!","2","15 February 2024"

It has terrible writing, characters, action setpieces and even acting. Dakota Johnson is so dull and boring as the main lead but this is probably down to the terrible script.To be fair, the movie does have an interesting concept with this Final Destination x Terminator thing. However, it is so poorly executed that it makes Morbius look like The Dark Knight.Anyway give me the ""He Was in the Amazon With My Mom When She Was Researching Spiders Right Before She Died"" cut!","1","17 February 2024"
"chenp-54708","Literally one of the worst superhero movies I have ever seen.From the advertisements, I knew this movie wasn't going to be great but still, it surprised me how bad and boring it was. Everything about the direction, writing, characters, technical aspects, and designs are really awful. The writing is poor as there are many concepts, ideas and aspects that are messy and bland. The messy script creates poor dialogue from the cast and the characters are not interesting. The special effects looked even worse than the marketing and all of the performances were pretty bad. I honestly do feel bad for Dakota Johnson cause she is a good actress but she deserves to have better roles then this. It can be said for the same for the rest of the cast members.The uses of product placements are annoying, action moments are dull, and and all in all, it was boring. Superhero movies shouldn't be boring but this really dragged on. It's unfortunate cause female superhero leads are something I love to see more like Wonder Woman and The Old Guard which are pretty fun. But unfortunately, it seemed that it likely isn't going to happen anytime soon.There really isn't anything else to say.Bad.","1","14 February 2024"
"AlsExGal","... when I saw Dakota Johnson was starring in it. Naturally I can't lay the entirety of this hot mess at her feet. But there is some really bad campy acting happening on her part, reminiscent of the Fifty Shades of Grey movies in which she starred. Perhaps it was because the director was more interested in the placement of Pepsi cans than her performance, but I digress.Basically, this movie plays out like the cut scenes from a budget Xbox 360 game. From the ground up this thing just feels designed to fail. It feels almost Producersesque in its approach in just how every aspect is seemingly intentionally mangled, yet no one seems to care. How have we come so full circle to go through the glory of Infinity War/Logan/The Dark Knight to arrive all the way back to Batman and Robin and Catwoman levels of superhero flicks? (Bam!, Pow!, Gosh yes Batman!)How did this movie make it so far that it has an actual release, and no one stopped it? How did this idea get green lit? Why did Sony give 80 million and turn over their valuable IP to the people that wrote Morbius, Gods of Egypt, Dracula Untold and The Last Witch Hunter? How did this get past the writing process and again have that script greenlit? How could no one on the set at any point stop things? How did no one in the editing room point out how bad it looked and how much of a mess it was?But to the suits it's not about art and story. Instead it's about business, and people are just a commodity. It's cheaper to recycle known quantities, and practice nepotism and involve maybe less than talented friends, people you've worked with before, than go out and find artists with worthy stories. They don't care about art, they don't care about stories, they care about making this work for them financially, regardless of loss of reputation with audiences as a whole.Youtuber Chris Stuckmann did a deep dive on the topic of big studios being generally run by folks who came up through management rather than the creative rungs such as writing and directing when he discussed this film. His take is worth watching. For some reason, Chris doesn't do critical movie reviews since he has become a filmmaker, but I can tell by his tone that, like me, he was completely displeased watching this one. I'd avoid it.","2","17 February 2024"
"eoinageary","This is, well I guess this is a movie in the Sony universe that I'm SHOCKED is profitable.The story is all over the place, it's basically about Madame Web who is a paramedic and develops powers and can see into the future, with a current threat she tries to change the future, teaming up with 3 powerful characters who are yet to develop into their full potential so she must shield them and change the future to protect them.Trying not to give the little story that gets told away in the opening there but i have to be vague.What I liked, one or two good scenes, I didn't mind the end, I really liked a lot of the camera work some cool looking shots and a decent Score.But the movie is BAD, it makes Morbius look like The Batman 2022. The acting is lacking, the actors look as bored as you will feel. Script is bad, just some beyond silly lines, the story chops and changes so much your neck will hurt you, some bad CGI, and just boring action.And before people harp on about ""you don't like it because it's women leads"" no, it's just a crap film, I enjoyed the marvels, Black Widow was decent, so no, the movie regardless of its leads is just poor.Extremely disappointing, 3/10.","3","14 February 2024"
"tbunker-88294","I can honestly say that once again (not that anyone is surprised) that Sony has bombed again with its superhero content. Underwhelming action, bad characters, weird dialogue, generic villain. Its just plain badI feel bad for the cast of this movie, you have EXCELLENT talent and its just wasted in this cash grab excuse of a movieSony has proved once again it can't be trusted with superhero content and has lost what little credibility it had. If the company had any integrity or wits left they should sell their share of ownership back to Marvel and let them assume FULL creative control.I'm not optimistic for Kraven The Hunter after seeing this gross disappointment.","1","14 February 2024"
"hotrobinproductions","Horrible from beginning to end, the opening scene just reeks of awful predictability from story & plot to the core. You know exactly what will happen before it even happens, the script sucks & the dialogue is even worse. There is quite noticeable audio dub edited after the fact too. This budget is 80 million, not that budget matters, because no amount of money could have saved this train wreck, but I mention this because you can still make a good film on lower budgets, Shazam, the first one, had the same budget & delt with a lot of side characters too, it's miles better, Godzilla minus one had a extremely low budget too. But this 80 million dollar film not just effects but production, feels obviously cheap, it almost feels like watching a very long pilot episode to a CW tv show.You thought Morbius was bad, that film was bad because it did the bare minimum, this film doesn't even do the bare minimum, it goes beyond comprehension below that, it just enters a point of no originality or ambition towards creating anything. There isn't even a single superhero moment, even horrible films like catwoman or Morbius has superhero moments & action, this thing doesn't, you get instead visions of the future to potentially set up sequels.This movie also has a serious problem of product placement, it's a long commercial, to be exact a long Pepsi commercial, I feel like Pepsi stopped the halftime show so they could invest in the product placement in this film. This movie was more important to them than the superbowl LOL it's just so over the top & obviously placed way too much in this film. Calvin Klein, Chase bank, the list goes on. This movie should be called superhero product placement the movie.It's barely even close to a 1/10 the cool moments are seeing what we already saw in the trailer when she's seeing the future & you think it's happening now but then it goes back to the moment she realizes it's a vision, granted it's cool the first couple times but it gets old REAL quick. & it ends up getting annoying because it's abused way too much.Thats about it, there isn't any redeeming things in this film, the acting isn't even good. I would say the 3 side character spider women that Dakota finds when they are together there was a potential spark. I saw the talent & potential, but they are failed big time by such a horrid script that the spark never even sparks, it's just like showing you the matches & gasoline & not setting the fire.Madame M0RBIUS / 10.","1","16 February 2024"
"olcare","It's the worst movie and superhero adaptation I've watched in recent years. Completely atrocious effects, atrocious screenplay, and atrocious acting. Also, a big insult to all comic book readers and those who know the original story.Let me describe the movie simply. First of all, I am filled with hatred; I really want to curse the entire creative team for this unacceptable film.All the performances are bad, everyone. There's not a single good actor trying; everyone just took the role for money. It's a terrible disgrace, a total eclipse of reason.The screenplay is the worst superhero screenplay I've ever seen. It barely resembles the original story, and if there aren't scenes like the other Spider-Girls in the trailer, why include them? There's no such obligation; instead, write a decent screenplay. All action scenes are full of logical errors; they've written it without thinking, it's complete garbage.Apart from these, the direction, sorry to say, is garbage too. Most scenes are shot as if they were taken straight from a phone camera; action scenes are not shown, they're hidden due to the atrociousness of the effects. It's shameful.After these general points, Sony urgently needs to cancel this universe; the original stories are garbage, there's no logic, no connection anywhere. They're just being shot randomly. I don't like to curse, but I hope this film sinks at the box office.The last scene with Madame Web gaining her powers, those web effects, clinging to souls, it's unbelievable how you approved this film, may God punish you.I don't know which one to talk about; all the atrocities are collected in this film. Whether it's the woman going to Peru and back in 30 seconds, Spider-Man dodging with fireworks, dancing at the boys' table when my daughters are left alone, not telling the story of the Spider-Human community, or the woman talking normally while giving birth at the end, everything is a disgrace. I hope this universe sinks, and you all get fired. No one involved in the management of this film deserves their job respectfully; they should quit immediately.Note: Dakota Johnson made a statement saying she didn't watch the movie. Why are you serving a completely garbage film if you're not going to watch it? Life shouldn't be all about money for you; we, in our poverty, are trying to watch it, and this is no different from cursing all the audience's families. Shame on you.Note 2: Just now, I looked at the budget of the movie, and my anger grew even more, 80 million dollars EIGHTY MILLION. How can I not believe this money, I really can't believe it, it's nothing but disrespect to yourself, disrespect to the audience, nothing but an insult.","1","16 February 2024"
"sinscopefilms","First Impression:The opening of the Madame Web was immersed in a mystique and ambition, enhanced by great musical score; yet, as the movie progresses, it becomes a mixed bag and a rollercoaster of emotions.The Positive:Musical Score and Sound Design: The standout feature of ""Madame Web"" is its musical score. The soundtrack not only enhances the emotional depth of the film but also succeeds in creating in some moments genuine goosebumps. The sound design really enhances this impact by carefully using sound pans, bass, and reverse effects. It creates a sense of tension and immersion which is one of the film's strongest features.The Mixed:Visual Effects and Costume Design: Some of the visual effects in ""Madame Web"" were visually appealing. The costume design, like Casey's red jacket and the three spider girl villain outfits standing out as particularly stunning contributions to the film's aesthetic, but it was not often shown in the film since the films direction and focus was different. I was disappointed.Acting and Direction: Although I thought Casey's character development - her ability to see the world from a different perspective - was great, I didn't like how it was visually presented. The way it was edited was poorly done. The editor could use 2 distinct color grading features where one sees the future and two, she sees the present moment.However, The performances throughout the film feel lackluster, with the actors appearing confused and disengaged. This, combined with direction that fails to maintain interest or coherence in many scenes, significantly undermines the film's potential.Negatives:Cinematography: Cinematography is bad since some pictures don't show a clear image. The camera moves so fast that I cannot comprehend the picture. I kind of recognized that it tries to initiate the rapidness of the events from the spider's eye point of view but it was a tasteless decision. The Cinematography is not something like wow. The reason why Cinematography was lacking is because it was heavily based on medium closeups and dutch tilts which on one hand was a unique choice but on the other hand very hard to watch. I found the 180 degree round camera rotations super cool, but again, I expected varied distance shots, not just medium shots. The train scene Cinematography was the best in the film.Editing and Pace: The editing is arguably the weakest element of ""Madame Web,"" with its rapid cuts and disjointed flow detracting significantly from the storytelling. This lack of coherence makes it challenging for the audience to fully engage with the narrative.Plot and Overall Execution: The storyline of ""Madame Web"" is cluttered and clichéd, suffering from a lack of originality and clear direction. The film's ambition is evident, but the execution falls short of creating a compelling narrative.The Conclusion:""Madame Web"" presents a paradoxical experience, with exceptional music and sound design standing that sharply contrasts with its various flaws in editing, cinematography, and direction.Although there are some visually and emotionally stunning moments, they are frequently overshadowed by a lack of coherence and clarity.Also, I think this film would be reasonable and great to be incorporated in a TV series which would have allowed for a more in-depth exploration of characters and plot.Nevertheless, Madame Web is a bit of a mixed bag, with moments of potential that ultimately leave the viewer something different visually.Rating: 3/10.","3","15 February 2024"
"Skruffbagg","Cannon, is that you in disguise?I firmly believe Madame Web will go down in history as not only the worst superhero movie, but also one of the worst movies ever made. It's that bad. It's absolutely fascinating to behold.Now, I'll be honest with you here. I only went to see this because I had heard it was an unmitigated disaster that had to be seen to be believed, and it truly does not disappoint - or massively does, depending on your viewpoint.It takes a special kind of director to get such cringe-inducing performances out of a fairly talented cast (Dakota Johnson and Tahar Rahim are both quality actors with the right script and direction), but SJ Clarkson somehow manages to wrangle the absolute worst imaginable from every single person in the film. I'll be very surprised if she ever does another feature after this.Nothing in this film works; the plot is moronic, the script seems like it was written by a teenager, the cinematography is horrendous, the aformentioned embarrassing performances, the audio editing is baffling (so much dubbing, brain-melting music choices). I'm amazed this didn't get shelved the minute the final cut was done.To me, I rate this as ""so bad it's good"" as I wasn't bored watching it, but most people I assume will say it's just plain bad... and it is, but very entertainingly so.If you love watching a 2hr car crash then I highly recommend this. The awfulness is mind-boggling in it's complexity, but in the best possible way. Film scholars and historians will be analysing this movie for years to come, and I hope it is talked about in the same vein as The Room in the future.An absolutely epic misfire on all levels.","1","20 February 2024"
"MiroslavKyuranov","It's astonishing to think that Sony could put out a worse product than 2022's Morbius, but boy, ""Madame Web"" manages it. It is an embarrassing mess. Talented stars wasted on probably one of the worst comic book movie ever (which nobody asked for). Filled with atrocious dialogue, awkward editing and laughable structure. It's a clunky, poorly-written, messy, and sloppy movie packed with some mediocre editing and performances.The concept is interesting on paper, but it couldn't be saved due to it's terrible execution. ""Madame Web"" simply lacked the spark it needed in nearly every dept.There is simply nothing memorable in this movie, except maybe some superhero costumes, but that doesn't redeem the fact that the movie is bad.So yeah...""Madame Web"" is yet another disappointing entry in the Sony's Spider-Less universe. It's like a love letter to an era of superhero films that people largely want to forget. The ""Pepsi"" adds are stand-out, it falls short of what could have been a decent movie in the hands of someone else twenty years ago.","4","14 February 2024"
"darrelltill","There is nothing good in this film. It's badly written - not just full of clichés but full of dialogue that is meant to sound like cliché superhero idioms yet butchered until they make no sense. It is nothing but a costume parade with players that are dead behind the eyes. You can tell that everybody involved knows it's going to be a stinker but they'd already signed on and it was too late. It would be great if this was the flop that made Disney rethink their output (I know, this is actually an SSU movie not an MCU movie, but they are all heading down the same path) but I fear it will take a few more. The solution is really simple - they need to adjust their hiring policy to include persons of talent.","1","15 February 2024"
"movieman6-413-929510","Madame Web is a new spin-off set in the Marvel Spider-Man world. This spin-off is directed, partly written and produced by S. J. Clarkson. Before this film, she directed more TV series episodes of superhero shows such as Jessica Jones and The Defenders.Cassandra Webb (Dakota Johnson) works as a paramedic in New York and learns after an accident that she has superpowers to see future possibilities. She sees that the lives of three girls are threatened by a mysterious masked man with spider-like powers.This is why she tries to protect the three girls and must convince them that their lives are really in danger. To truly protect them, they must ensure that the three listen to her and learn to work together.The story of this film has an interesting concept, but the final story and screenplay were written by five different writers. These writers do not always seem to have been on the same page, because the story sometimes seems a bit rushed or frayed. It sometimes seems as if they didn't really know what exactly to do with it, or what the film studio despised of them. The screenplay has also been rewritten many times, so the cast members could no longer always follow exactly where they were going or supposed to do with the film.Despite these messy, rushed aspects, the film remains on a familiar, predictable side for a superhero film. This can make the film seem a bit long-winded or embarrassing. The film is reminiscent of other superhero films that came out around the year 2000, but of a somewhat lesser quality.The visual effects don't always look believable either. The blue screen and CGI can be seen in the film. For some of the cast members, this was also the first time they had actually worked in a film with such visual effects. The fact that they have little or no experience with these film situations is sometimes reflected in their acting.The poor script also gives the cast members few opportunities to make something special of their roles. Dakota Johnson also seemed a bit uncomfortable during promotions of the film, or ignorant of how to properly promote this film. In the final film she tries to make the best of the role and tries to add some comedy to the role, but she doesn't always get the chance to do this. Sydney Sweeney, Isabela Merced and Celeste O'Connor play the three girls Cassandra tries to protect. All three are given a little time to give their characters some personalities, but unfortunately not enough to make you as a viewer really care about the three. For a better focused film, they might have been better off using a character in the story, who Cassandra then has to protect. Tahar Rahim plays the villain in the film, who tries to kill the three girls, but also deals with the poor, weak script. As a result, he does not emerge as strongly as the villain of the story. They also didn't incorporate his audio work well into the film, because his lips sometimes don't always match what his character is saying.With all these superhero spin-off films from the Sony film studio, they only make Marvel's current film series more messy. If Sony and Disney Marvel try to collaborate on the same film series, they will have to consult each other more and better and plan where they want to go with this film series.","2","17 February 2024"
"ethanbresnett","Based on Madame Web's woeful reviews I was expecting this film to be an utter car crash. To its credit I will say it isn't entirely without merit, but it is incredibly boring and bland.Mostly this is because nothing particularly happens. It's a superhero movie with little to no superhero action and a painfully long set up for an underwhelming final act. The characters are so underdeveloped that there is no emotional connection or investment in any of them. Everything about the story and writing just feels lazy, vacuous and corny.Then there's the villain who is utterly uninspiring. He is constantly complaining about 'everything he has built' being destroyed. What has he built you might ask? The film has no interest in exploring this question. He's easily one of the more two dimensional and weak superhero villains I've ever seen committed to screen.Perhaps the most heinous crime this movie commits is to waste the talents of Dakota Johnson, Sydney Sweeney, Adam Scott, Emma Roberts, Zosia Mamet and more. Such a good cast was assembled and they were given absolutely nothing to work with, so I don't blame the performers. It's just such a shame to see such great talent put to the sword like this.As if all of this wasn't enough, the movie also feels remarkably low budget and feels excruciatingly long despite its relatively short runtime.Ultimately I think this film suffered because it was clearly intended as a set up for a wider Spider-Woman franchise which is unlikely to come to fruition. There seemed to be no interest in making a good stand alone movie, and no respect for the audience. A massive waste of time.","3","21 February 2024"
"vfphvnpp","I understand what the plan was here. They wanted a trippy film, focusing on a strong future for the Sony verse. The problem is the delivery. The camera work in this movie made it quite irritating to follow, as there was constant quick close up shots of the action. The dialogue was awful, and there was quite a lot of blatant voice over during the villain scenes.So much wasted time was given to boring scenes in the movie, which led me to believe the screen writers finished the script and realised that it was under the word count.Honestly the acting quality was quite poor across the board, especially the villain, who honestly seems as if they didn't cast for his role at all, just picked up someone off the side of the road.For someone who's guilty pleasure is watching bad movies, I it was a painful time. Don't recommend.","2","14 February 2024"
"jtorch-11283","Don't waste your time, and money seeing this in theaters. I was fooled by the trailer which looked promising. All the action in the whole film ( a total of 2 scenes) is shown in the the trailer. The rest of the movie is just terrible acting trying to save an even worse scrip.I'm honestly not sure how this made it to the big screen. I'm not a cinema expert, but shouldn't someone have to view the finished product and give the O. K. At some point before it is ""audience ready?"" I feel like that step in the process was skipped. I don't know what Marvel had to do with this film, but it certainly isn't the Iron-Man-Marvel I keep hoping they will somehow revive.And to whom it may concern, ""my parents don't love me."" Is neither a solid backstory OR a strong character trait. I hope you eat a lot of money on this movie.","1","15 February 2024"
"cosby_don","I don't know where to start-actually, I do! THIS IS THE WORST MOVIE IN THE HISTORY OF HUMANITY. I'm not kidding.I'm not sure what other movie this Dakota Johnson has been in, but after watching THIS movie, I'll probably never support her again. This was an absolute career killer. Ms. Johnson, please FIRE your agent immediately.To the production crew, editors, director, and ESPECIALLY the writers (I counted 4 writers-that's RIDICULOUS), shame on you for contributing to this mess. It's obvious you've traded in your morals for a paycheck. That's Hollywood for ya'.Did I mention that this movie was HORRENDOUSLY bad? Everything about this movie was bad-there are ZERO redeeming qualities.The story: STUPID. Worst I've ever seen, seriously. Madam Web ask the girls to wait for 3 hours in the woods? STUPID. The guy partner keeping the girls as Madam Web flies to Peru to check something out. STUPID. Madam a Web getting her powers from a spider bite through her mother. STUPID. I could seriously go on and on. I'm not kidding-EVERYTHING in this movie was STUPID. I can't count how many times I shook my head and said ""This is so bad.""The acting? Very wooden. Ms. Dakota Johnson's acting chops were the worst of the worst here. I really pray that she's done work much better. The other girls-they tried. Jokes fell flat, and they said the DUMBEST lines ever in a movie. I was seriously angry at how dumb they were.The villain? The most generic, uninteresting, uncool villain over ever seen on film. Not one memorable quote. Come to think, did he even make a ""evil guy"" speech? Nope!The ending? Oh my, HORRENDOUS. She's smiling in her glasses while paralyzed in a wheel chair?

"rgkarim","LIKES:The Commentary At Times
-Some lines in this movie are startling at how funny they were for me, a fantastic bout of teenage emotions with a less than thrilled babysitter.-Madame Web's origin story is almost like an anti-hero tale to Charles Xavier idea, and though it's not fully fleshed out, there is emotion, fun, and what felt natural angst and vulnerability into it.-With the right timing, and build up, this section of commentary was a striking positive in this reviewers book.Representation of Paramedics
-It's a rare thing to get to actually see E. M. T's in their work and what they give to serve the public.-While a bit forced, and perhaps a tad overdone and cheesy, kudos for Madame Web accomplishing some detailed shots of them serving the public and giving a little character development with it.-There were great avenues taken to help ingrain parts into the story, and with that, the medical nerd inside me found a cool little nod in those sequences.Some Artistic Visuals Are Cool
-I'm a sucker for a good shot and a good artistic visual popping out and ingraining itself into my mind.-Madame Web has some of these moments for me, the creepy and yet serene world of the Web World, being one that holds majesty and mystery, but also the very emotions of the person trying to wield it.-Other shots of costume crusaders striking that right pose, or perhaps that nostalgic early 2000s look, really help establish some of the themes of the movie or a good set up visual to cascade into.-It may be sprinkled about, but there were some superhero visuals that accomplished the job for me in Madame Web.Talented Cast
-Celeste O'Connor is very fun in this movie. A tad quirky, but she keeps the attitude going, a lot of that sass very fun and usually well-placed to help move the story towards forced comedy and obvious story telling.-Merced eventually grew on me after she got into the meat of her character and starting to push past the stubborn and cheeky attitude. She's got charming charisma, a fun brainy side to exploit, and this sadness that she uses to illicit such emotion, something I wanted more of, but got only little.-Sweeney is fun in this movie. Toned down from the other roles I've seen, the woman knows how to adapt her style and give me something to hook to several times. I love the awkwardness she brings, the tie in to the two extremes, and her surprising smallness after she plays such big roles.-And Johnson is about the same as she always is. A snarky and condescending nature that she wields expertly, but a tad dry at times that some lines feel unfulfilled. Fortunately, she's got good chemistry with the girls that assisted in smoothing out the faults.Some Surprising Character Arcs
-The movie may miss a lot of things, but there are a few moments that work very well to show the potential of Madame Web if given the right focus.-An opening that holds some merit was one of the victories, something that would eventually bleed into plot points further on that gave you a very touching moment.-And another element has the other's origin stories granting us some potential hurt and relatable tales to latch onto and acknowledge. Again, helping give a young and in your face Charlie's Angel group some vim and vigor.The Music
-Call me a sucker for nostalgia, Madame Web has a mix of songs that were perfect for viewers like me to enjoy.-Comedic use of the songs are not the most creative, but add that minor element to help give the girls a little more dynamic and believability.-While other times, it's just a blast of the speakers and me dancing in my seat as the forgotten wonder returns for another run to get things started.DISLIKES:The Pacing Uneven
-Despite the trinkets and some merits to the story, Madame Web's dislikes for me start with the pacing of the tale.-A moderately slow start did little to keep me engaged, only to then have these sprints of faster moments to try to change things up, before hitting the brakes again.-Like a CW season crammed into one, Madame Web's pacing feels a lot like dressed up teenage drama trying to give realism and gradual steps, but really just being the mashup of the uglier time use dramas can get stuck to.The Stale Mechanic
-From the trailers, you know there is some type of vision gimmick that Cassie is supposed to use to protect her charges.-That gimmick gets stale very quickly for a viewer like me, the convoluted presentation starting out fun at first, but then turning into annoying déjà vu that felt more like reshoots than actual artistic twisting.-Like Moon Knight, that element makes sense at first, but really could have stopped halfway through the movie once the viewers has connected the powers.-Had there been a bit more excitement, fighting, or even better storytelling to distract, it would have been less impactful, but alas, for me, all the other limitations added up.Lack of Other Character Development
-There are a lot of characters in this movie, some played by bigger names than the leads themselves. And yet, their time and character development felt shoehorned than planned out.-Adam Scott and Emma Roberts seem disengaged, with stories that are cliché, simplistic, and a waste of talent that again showed potential with that slower pacing at the start.-But even the villain and main girls tales feel very bland, and that lack of character development was very much felt by me that it almost seems to rely heavily on another movie to do these characters justice.Annoying Dialogue
-I know, I said the commentary was good, but that was a small amount of it compared to the whole.-Madame Web's dialogue seems to have gone through the writing grinder several times, very loaded with one liners, sassy comments and attitude that seemed to be out of place for much of the film for me.-Statements of the obvious, corny dialogue essentially pushed in with too simplistic of writing and in your face, overdramatic flair to count as quality dialogue. It needs tuning up, needs to be less forceful, and try to add a little Hollywood magic to help tenderize it to something matching a comic book movie.A Villain Needing A Lot More
-Don't get me wrong, there is an element to him that is relatable, believable, and indeed threatening in terms of the madness of his actions.-But outside of this and the opening scene, Ezekiel is a very bland bad guy who just didn't get the time to shine outside of crawling and repeating the same lines over and over.-The direction failed to give him any recognizable skills, his threats empty most of the time and sort of creepy obsessive, and dare I say his actual character is zoomed over and practically absent but for the opening line.-To me, that's a limited villain and one major flaw that much of the movie suffers from.Visuals Get Really Muddy/Bad
-Sony makes such great looking video games, and yet their movies still suffer from last gen effects
-While the artistic flair of those moments was enjoyable, they did have that faux effect that dropped some of the realism this movie was going for.-Even worse, there are lots of movements, character renderings, and powers that leave a lot to be desired in looking their best. I won't say it's a dealbreaker, but it doesn't help to have such limited technology presentation.Scenes/Story Seem Very Chopped Up
-Between the gimmicks and pacing, the scenes already feel limited, messy, and almost like an abbreviated version of what they could be.-Sure, the dialogue gives you everything they are going for, but the presentation felt very much like a lot of reshoots of the same scene, and slight changes that made little difference.-Such indecisive direction and edits got away from them and left me just wondering what this film could have been with half the gimmicks of the visions pulled back.The Action Is Very Boring
-No denying this, Madame Web maybe even worse than many of the CW attempts at action.-While witty, and an amusing game of cat and mouse, a Spiderverse without a solid one or two fights is a verse I'm not fond playing in for nearly two hours.-A lame villain does little but strut and crawl, while our cast somehow running away and eluding comes off a bit pathetic than entertaining.-Even the climax is a mess, rushed finishes, suspense of disbelief, and an overdramatic battle of words with a very extravagant and mushy ending to cap it off.-Eternals at least had a few moves that had me rocking in my seat, but this... this was a challenge to stay awake in.The VERDICT:
Madame Web is certainly not the worst movie I've seen in years, but that doesn't mean Sony's latest is a masterpiece either. There are elements of this vision that show the potential for a good future, but need a lot of work to make up for this rushed installment. A talented cast, music and some fun writing can be the starting building blocks, but it can't offset what feels like lots of production limitations, rewrites, and editing that greatly show in this movie. Boring battles, annoying gimmicks, and under developed characters despite a strong cast were just some of the limitations this movie has to work through if a series is to come with it. Should one see it in theaters? Not really. A shot at home, I would say sure, but with all of this, my scores for the movie are:Action/Adventure/Sci-Fi: 6.0
Movie Overall: 5.0.","5","15 February 2024"
"eddie_baggins","I'm not ashamed to admit I've seen some movies in my time.I am however ashamed to admit curiosity got the better of me and I ended up in an almost entirely empty cinema screening (thanks to one tolerant movie buddy who joined me on my trip to the local cinema) partaking in what can only be described as one of the most universally panned Hollywood blockbusters of the modern era.Not at all interested in watching another Sony Marvel outing after their last few efforts, hearing about the insanely awesome awfulness of Madame Web from friends, internet identities and esteemed critics made me want to witness a potential all-time cringe-fest and while when people are absolutely right in their hyperbole around just how bad Madame Web is, I'm still trying to comprehend how I could possibly testify to just how bad things are here.Directed by long time TV episode director S. J. Clarkson and featuring a cast of performers who have all proven over time to be more than capable of bringing the goods, Madame Web is not devoid of talent that may have been able to salvage some type of goodness from an offence against the entire cinematic medium but as a finished? (Honestly I am unsure how anyone could claim this is an acceptable final version, just watch for some of the most flawed examples of ADR you're ever going to see) product there was no one or any thing that could've saved this nightmare from the fate it had created for itself.An experience that could only possibly come from a collective group who all gave up the fight to save it long before shooting had wrapped, Madame Web inexcusably comes from the same penmanship that was guilty of unleashing Morbius on us but screenwriters Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless at least managed to find some cult like goodness in Jared Leto and Matt Smith's wildly OTT characters and bizarre action segments but Madame Web is nothing more than two hours of terrible plot, characters, spectacle and intentions and there is quite literally no valid reason for this movie to exist in the form it has been given.One of the most atrociously acted Hollywood films ever captured, with lead Dakota Johnson unable to hold back her disdain for a film she clearly hated being a part of and poor old Tahar Rahim taking the films most unfortunate mantle from a wigged Sydney Sweeney, Madame Web may have been promoted as some type of intense action thriller following the exploits of Johnson's Cassandra Webb as she battles Rahim's Ezekiel Sims alongside Sweeney's Julia, Isabela Merced's Anya and Celeste O'Connor's Mattie but we get something else entirely that is hard to come to terms with.From some of the most detestable and frequent examples of product placement that becomes instantly iconic (some viewers may find themselves attempting to crack open a Pepsi can in their Calvin Klein's after a viewing), a villain we literally know nothing about with zero attempts to bother explaining his plans or background, an embarrassing use of comic staple characters that aren't even put into action outside of dream sequences and a script that must surely have been conjured on ChatGPT, Madame Web is a cesspool of Hollywood excrement that isn't even funny in its horribleness, just merely sad and depressing.The only justifiable reason for Madame Web to be the film it is as it stands is if Sony are deliberately attempting to sabotage their Marvel property that no longer is allowed to include many fan favourites, if they aren't in fact doing that there is zero excuses for why Madame Web has ever been allowed to be birthed into existence.An irredeemable, amateurish and embarrassing exercise in pointless, Madame Web is a shockingly bad example of blockbuster filmmaking that is the exact type of bottom feeder product the cinema industry and the Marvel brand didn't need at this particular point of time.Final Say -If you're a glutton for punishment and want to be reminded of everything you wouldn't wish to see in a supposed piece of big screen entertainment then Madame Web is for you! A truly iconic new addition to the staples of all-time misfires, nothing could prepare one for the garbage that is this $80 million dollar disasterpiece.0 fireworks to the head out of 5.Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)","1","22 February 2024"
"shaikhirshad-41223","Literally I had zero expectations when I went to watch this flick but I still thought that something should be good in this to watch at least one time because of marvel name in it. But this movie is so low and looks like low budget CGI thriller and a comedy in the name of superhero genre.I mean from the start itself movie lost it's pace and story and god only knows what are they showing no interest in the screenplay and the plot is not even engaging to watch for at least 30 mins.I only went for Dakota & Sydney just because the screen presence of them looks good, but the director loss this opportunity too. Because the character they're playing is so bad and not even proper dialogues are given and just they have made a common character with no story arc just the situation that they have to act
I've never seen such a bad cinematography of any film it looks like they don't have any interest making this film so they just made a spoof just to show that we are making a movie. Don't know what to say more because this film is that bad.Overall a Boring fest and a spoof fo a superhero genre.","2","16 February 2024"
"vengeance20","Ok, so before people come at me with the ""YoU dIdN't LiKe It BeCaUsE iT wAs FeMaLe LeAd."" chestnut. I went into this one with an open mind, but expecting it to be as described & the reviews were right. The film is bad.The film sees Cassandra Webb who is a New York metropolis paramedic who begins to demonstrate signs of clairvoyance. Forced to challenge revelations about her past, she needs to safeguard 3 young girls from a deadly adversary who wants them destroyed.I found the film to be pretty bad. It's disjointed, clunky, poorly paced & just feels very awkward & stiff. The characters are personality-less, they look & sound as if they're reciting their lines from cue cards (almost robotic, I might add) & the script reads like a supermarket shopping receipt.The films story is all over the place, confusing & hard to follow. The premonition sequences the main lead experiences were annoying & while creative, were repetitive to the point where you couldn't tell if she was hallucinating or actually seeing what she was seeing.The films runtime is overly long for what it is, while not as bad as other films which are generally over 2 hours (rolls eyes), this film felt longer & as I said was too long for what it was at 1 hour & 48 minutes (108 minutes) without credits & the pacing, jeez... don't get me started.The actors were alright, but what they were given script wise, didn't work & made them come across as flat. There's some action & not bad effects to be had, but that's pretty much the only redeeming features from this flick, sadly. It hasn't a lot going for it & is pretty lack luster & basic.Don't get me wrong, I prefer films with straight forward story-lines & plots you can follow, but this one was a bit too basic & could've used more meatiness to beef it up more as well as more emphasis to keep the audience engaged with the story, characters, action etc.I generally didn't like the film & the ending is just out there too & is pretty cringy like some of the scenes in the film as well as the few cringy action sequences themselves among some of the good action we got.Overall, it's a bad film. And no, it's got nothing to do with the old chestnut of me being a man who doesn't like the film because it's female lead. The film was bad & had plenty of things wrong with it. People in general, men & women, boys & girls, didn't like this flick.The story is bland, boring & paper thin like the characters & leads, the little bit of good action & effects seen are overshadowed by the aforementioned issues as well as the other issues like the poor runtime, pacing & the lacking engagement the film has.Also, for those who can't seem to get it in their heads, there's been plenty of female lead films in the past that have done well, from the Alien Franchise to The Hunger Games along with Elektra, Tomb Raider, Salt, Lucy, Hanna etc. I could go on but that's my rant for those who need calling out.2/10.","2","20 February 2024"
"izadyardariush","I could tell from the beginning, making this movie was a bad idea. After I saw the cast I could tell this movie doomed. I have nothing against any of those actors but I must say casting a Dakota was a biggest mistake for the role! Anyone read the comics could say that. This movie was like terminator meeting final destination! No good story, big mess, lot of waste of potentials. I must say worst choice of villain!

"alindsayal","With Marvel Studios taking on more responsibility involving Spider-Man, Sony have decided to try and build a universe involving smaller characters from the same lore as him. We have had Venom and Morbius and will get Kraven The Hunter later this year but here we have Madame Web. I saw this film last night and here is my review for Madame Web. The p[remise of the film sees a women bestowed with powers where she has to save 3 girls from being killed by a villainous foe.Main Character
I must be honest that I have never been a huge fan of Dakota Johnson and she plays Cassandra Web here and I have to be honest she isn't particularly good here. She is overacting everything here and her character is super unlikeable and hard to care about. She is clearly hampered by the awful writing in this film and she can't rise above it and give us a lead role to support or care about and Cassie Web will go down as one of the worst leads in a comic book film ever.Supporting Characters
Sydney Sweeney, Isabela Merced & Celeste O'Connor play the three girls that are in the view of the villain and they are all pretty awful. Their characters are really awkward and not particularly likeable, the film tries to force you to like and care about these characters but it comes across poorly and these actresses aren't good enough to make me care.Tahar Rahim plays Ezekiel Sims and he is one of the more frustrating parts of this film because I have seen him be a good actor and this character had some potential but the film really flops here and makes him this over the top villain that is so stupid that it really takes you out of the film.Adam Scott as Ben Parker is probably the best person here but he isn't really given much to do and it still upsets me that he plays Ben Parker and it is really clear that this was just done to provide some stupid fan service that actually annoys me even more.Story
The story is nonsensical and completely stupid. The plot makes no sense and characters do things that make no sense, Cassie Web in particular is one of the dumbest characters that I have seen in recent movies. This film also tries its best to ruin the character of Spider-Man even though he isn't in the film and it is just the backdrop to this pretty dull and horrendous adventure.Script
This is a really awfully written film. Things make no sense, characters are unlikeable and there is no humour here at all. There are so many plot holes it is crazy and the film has nothing interesting about it at all.Style
I mean I guess the action scenes are okay and the bad guys suit was okay but that is it. The film is filmed really poorly, the editing looks unfinished and at times it is actually quite jarring to watch it. There are way too many jump scares especially for a film that is not a horror film. The trailer shows things that barely happen in the film and it feels like we were sold a different film that never got made.Overall
Overall, Madame Web is a truly disastrous film. This is up there with one of the worst films I have ever seen and is up there with the worst comic book films of all time. Though I am glad I saw this film to have this experience but at all cost avoid this garbage and do something better for 2 hours.Rating - 1/10.","1","16 February 2024"
"daisukereds","A baby-sitting movie in a Superhero setting, where the lead can see the future and has to prevent NOT-Spiderman from killing teenagers (because he has dreams/visions about them). The girls run and hide around a lot, some BS happens and then the movie ends.The foundation of the script is heavily written around a hollow core of ""parents and children"". The cinematography is actually good, and at least ""teaches"" how to do CPR. It also does away with showing premonitions every time something is to be changed near the end.. respecting the viewers intelligence in at least that aspect! And it's easy to follow (if you don't fall asleep) with how simplistic it is.Aside from that, it is barely anything else..
The movie itself isn't terrible.. it's just beyond bland and boring. Also, calling this a Superhero movie is really disingenuous and a marketing ploy to get people to see it. Stay home! There are no good action sequences and nobody is written memorably....
Venom making money was a mistake. Sony has half a franchise, and they can't get anyone talented enough to do something with it. And what they continue to release seems like high-budgeted fan fiction!","3","16 February 2024"
"isaacsundaralingam","Yea, this was garbage and that's saying plenty. It's actually adorable how little anyone cared about ""Madame Web"" - not just the audience, but the filmmakers and actors themselves. Written by the same people who wrote ""Morbius"", this movie is yet another reason to not let them anywhere near a writing software ever again.Not only was the movie unwatchable due to how lifeless it was, but it was also criminally boring. You're waiting for something to happen and you keep waiting right until the credits start to roll. Nothing about the movie was compelling, the plot was riddled with plot holes, the screenplay was lazy, the dialogues were dead and the acting was almost as if the actors were held captive and being forced to act as if everything was okay. It reeks of corporate greed and there isn't a single positive thing to say about this movie.We're only a month and half into the year and we already have a very strong contender for what might be the worst movie of the year, and it's not even close. Don't watch it, but if you do indeed decide to, I hope you lived a life well enough to have a crowded funeral.","1","19 February 2024"
"syntory","Look at the profiles for the writers that wrote Madame Web. You'll see virtually every movie they've written has a bad rating and bad reviews. Why then does Hollywood continually hire these same writers for these big budget films? I could understand if they wrote movies for Asylum Films because all their movies are terrible.Madame Web is god awful! Very difficult to sit through. None of the main characters are likeable. Even the villain is lame. It seems like the entire movie was written to set up a sequel. But why would people spend money to see the sequel of a movie that is one of the worst movies ever written? I'm shocked at how bad this movie is and if there is a sequel I certainly wont bother watching it.Stop hiring bad writers, Hollywood!","2","15 February 2024"
"MovieWarfare","I would absolutely love to be in these Sony meetings because I am absolutely baffled how things like Madame Web are getting greenlit.Madame Web is one of the worst superhero movies ever made! It has terrible writing, characters, action setpieces and even acting. Dakota Johnson is so dull and boring as the main lead but this is probably down to the terrible script.To be fair, the movie does have an interesting concept with this Final Destination x Terminator thing. However, it is so poorly executed that it makes Morbius look like The Dark Knight.Anyway give me the ""He Was in the Amazon With My Mom When She Was Researching Spiders Right Before She Died"" cut!","1","17 February 2024"
"chenp-54708","Literally one of the worst superhero movies I have ever seen.From the advertisements, I knew this movie wasn't going to be great but still, it surprised me how bad and boring it was. Everything about the direction, writing, characters, technical aspects, and designs are really awful. The writing is poor as there are many concepts, ideas and aspects that are messy and bland. The messy script creates poor dialogue from the cast and the characters are not interesting. The special effects looked even worse than the marketing and all of the performances were pretty bad. I honestly do feel bad for Dakota Johnson cause she is a good actress but she deserves to have better roles then this. It can be said for the same for the rest of the cast members.The uses of product placements are annoying, action moments are dull, and and all in all, it was boring. Superhero movies shouldn't be boring but this really dragged on. It's unfortunate cause female superhero leads are something I love to see more like Wonder Woman and The Old Guard which are pretty fun. But unfortunately, it seemed that it likely isn't going to happen anytime soon.There really isn't anything else to say.Bad.","1","14 February 2024"
"AlsExGal","... when I saw Dakota Johnson was starring in it. Naturally I can't lay the entirety of this hot mess at her feet. But there is some really bad campy acting happening on her part, reminiscent of the Fifty Shades of Grey movies in which she starred. Perhaps it was because the director was more interested in the placement of Pepsi cans than her performance, but I digress.Basically, this movie plays out like the cut scenes from a budget Xbox 360 game. From the ground up this thing just feels designed to fail. It feels almost Producersesque in its approach in just how every aspect is seemingly intentionally mangled, yet no one seems to care. How have we come so full circle to go through the glory of Infinity War/Logan/The Dark Knight to arrive all the way back to Batman and Robin and Catwoman levels of superhero flicks? (Bam!, Pow!, Gosh yes Batman!)How did this movie make it so far that it has an actual release, and no one stopped it? How did this idea get green lit? Why did Sony give 80 million and turn over their valuable IP to the people that wrote Morbius, Gods of Egypt, Dracula Untold and The Last Witch Hunter? How did this get past the writing process and again have that script greenlit? How could no one on the set at any point stop things? How did no one in the editing room point out how bad it looked and how much of a mess it was?But to the suits it's not about art and story. Instead it's about business, and people are just a commodity. It's cheaper to recycle known quantities, and practice nepotism and involve maybe less than talented friends, people you've worked with before, than go out and find artists with worthy stories. They don't care about art, they don't care about stories, they care about making this work for them financially, regardless of loss of reputation with audiences as a whole.Youtuber Chris Stuckmann did a deep dive on the topic of big studios being generally run by folks who came up through management rather than the creative rungs such as writing and directing when he discussed this film. His take is worth watching. For some reason, Chris doesn't do critical movie reviews since he has become a filmmaker, but I can tell by his tone that, like me, he was completely displeased watching this one. I'd avoid it.","2","17 February 2024"
"eoinageary","This is, well I guess this is a movie in the Sony universe that I'm SHOCKED is profitable.The story is all over the place, it's basically about Madame Web who is a paramedic and develops powers and can see into the future, with a current threat she tries to change the future, teaming up with 3 powerful characters who are yet to develop into their full potential so she must shield them and change the future to protect them.Trying not to give the little story that gets told away in the opening there but i have to be vague.What I liked, one or two good scenes, I didn't mind the end, I really liked a lot of the camera work some cool looking shots and a decent Score.But the movie is BAD, it makes Morbius look like The Batman 2022. The acting is lacking, the actors look as bored as you will feel. Script is bad, just some beyond silly lines, the story chops and changes so much your neck will hurt you, some bad CGI, and just boring action.And before people harp on about ""you don't like it because it's women leads"" no, it's just a crap film, I enjoyed the marvels, Black Widow was decent, so no, the movie regardless of its leads is just poor.Extremely disappointing, 3/10.","3","14 February 2024"

"hotrobinproductions","Horrible from beginning to end, the opening scene just reeks of awful predictability from story & plot to the core. You know exactly what will happen before it even happens, the script sucks & the dialogue is even worse. There is quite noticeable audio dub edited after the fact too. This budget is 80 million, not that budget matters, because no amount of money could have saved this train wreck, but I mention this because you can still make a good film on lower budgets, Shazam, the first one, had the same budget & delt with a lot of side characters too, it's miles better, Godzilla minus one had a extremely low budget too. But this 80 million dollar film not just effects but production, feels obviously cheap, it almost feels like watching a very long pilot episode to a CW tv show.You thought Morbius was bad, that film was bad because it did the bare minimum, this film doesn't even do the bare minimum, it goes beyond comprehension below that, it just enters a point of no originality or ambition towards creating anything. There isn't even a single superhero moment, even horrible films like catwoman or Morbius has superhero moments & action, this thing doesn't, you get instead visions of the future to potentially set up sequels.This movie also has a serious problem of product placement, it's a long commercial, to be exact a long Pepsi commercial, I feel like Pepsi stopped the halftime show so they could invest in the product placement in this film. This movie was more important to them than the superbowl LOL it's just so over the top & obviously placed way too much in this film. Calvin Klein, Chase bank, the list goes on. This movie should be called superhero product placement the movie.It's barely even close to a 1/10 the cool moments are seeing what we already saw in the trailer when she's seeing the future & you think it's happening now but then it goes back to the moment she realizes it's a vision, granted it's cool the first couple times but it gets old REAL quick. & it ends up getting annoying because it's abused way too much.Thats about it, there isn't any redeeming things in this film, the acting isn't even good. I would say the 3 side character spider women that Dakota finds when they are together there was a potential spark. I saw the talent & potential, but they are failed big time by such a horrid script that the spark never even sparks, it's just like showing you the matches & gasoline & not setting the fire.Madame M0RBIUS / 10.","1","16 February 2024"
"olcare","It's the worst movie and superhero adaptation I've watched in recent years. Completely atrocious effects, atrocious screenplay, and atrocious acting. Also, a big insult to all comic book readers and those who know the original story.Let me describe the movie simply. First of all, I am filled with hatred; I really want to curse the entire creative team for this unacceptable film.All the performances are bad, everyone. There's not a single good actor trying; everyone just took the role for money. It's a terrible disgrace, a total eclipse of reason.The screenplay is the worst superhero screenplay I've ever seen. It barely resembles the original story, and if there aren't scenes like the other Spider-Girls in the trailer, why include them? There's no such obligation; instead, write a decent screenplay. All action scenes are full of logical errors; they've written it without thinking, it's complete garbage.Apart from these, the direction, sorry to say, is garbage too. Most scenes are shot as if they were taken straight from a phone camera; action scenes are not shown, they're hidden due to the atrociousness of the effects. It's shameful.After these general points, Sony urgently needs to cancel this universe; the original stories are garbage, there's no logic, no connection anywhere. They're just being shot randomly. I don't like to curse, but I hope this film sinks at the box office.The last scene with Madame Web gaining her powers, those web effects, clinging to souls, it's unbelievable how you approved this film, may God punish you.I don't know which one to talk about; all the atrocities are collected in this film. Whether it's the woman going to Peru and back in 30 seconds, Spider-Man dodging with fireworks, dancing at the boys' table when my daughters are left alone, not telling the story of the Spider-Human community, or the woman talking normally while giving birth at the end, everything is a disgrace. I hope this universe sinks, and you all get fired. No one involved in the management of this film deserves their job respectfully; they should quit immediately.Note: Dakota Johnson made a statement saying she didn't watch the movie. Why are you serving a completely garbage film if you're not going to watch it? Life shouldn't be all about money for you; we, in our poverty, are trying to watch it, and this is no different from cursing all the audience's families. Shame on you.Note 2: Just now, I looked at the budget of the movie, and my anger grew even more, 80 million dollars EIGHTY MILLION. How can I not believe this money, I really can't believe it, it's nothing but disrespect to yourself, disrespect to the audience, nothing but an insult.","1","16 February 2024"
"sinscopefilms","First Impression:The opening of the Madame Web was immersed in a mystique and ambition, enhanced by great musical score; yet, as the movie progresses, it becomes a mixed bag and a rollercoaster of emotions.The Positive:Musical Score and Sound Design: The standout feature of ""Madame Web"" is its musical score. The soundtrack not only enhances the emotional depth of the film but also succeeds in creating in some moments genuine goosebumps. The sound design really enhances this impact by carefully using sound pans, bass, and reverse effects. It creates a sense of tension and immersion which is one of the film's strongest features.The Mixed:Visual Effects and Costume Design: Some of the visual effects in ""Madame Web"" were visually appealing. The costume design, like Casey's red jacket and the three spider girl villain outfits standing out as particularly stunning contributions to the film's aesthetic, but it was not often shown in the film since the films direction and focus was different. I was disappointed.Acting and Direction: Although I thought Casey's character development - her ability to see the world from a different perspective - was great, I didn't like how it was visually presented. The way it was edited was poorly done. The editor could use 2 distinct color grading features where one sees the future and two, she sees the present moment.However, The performances throughout the film feel lackluster, with the actors appearing confused and disengaged. This, combined with direction that fails to maintain interest or coherence in many scenes, significantly undermines the film's potential.Negatives:Cinematography: Cinematography is bad since some pictures don't show a clear image. The camera moves so fast that I cannot comprehend the picture. I kind of recognized that it tries to initiate the rapidness of the events from the spider's eye point of view but it was a tasteless decision. The Cinematography is not something like wow. The reason why Cinematography was lacking is because it was heavily based on medium closeups and dutch tilts which on one hand was a unique choice but on the other hand very hard to watch. I found the 180 degree round camera rotations super cool, but again, I expected varied distance shots, not just medium shots. The train scene Cinematography was the best in the film.Editing and Pace: The editing is arguably the weakest element of ""Madame Web,"" with its rapid cuts and disjointed flow detracting significantly from the storytelling. This lack of coherence makes it challenging for the audience to fully engage with the narrative.Plot and Overall Execution: The storyline of ""Madame Web"" is cluttered and clichéd, suffering from a lack of originality and clear direction. The film's ambition is evident, but the execution falls short of creating a compelling narrative.The Conclusion:""Madame Web"" presents a paradoxical experience, with exceptional music and sound design standing that sharply contrasts with its various flaws in editing, cinematography, and direction.Although there are some visually and emotionally stunning moments, they are frequently overshadowed by a lack of coherence and clarity.Also, I think this film would be reasonable and great to be incorporated in a TV series which would have allowed for a more in-depth exploration of characters and plot.Nevertheless, Madame Web is a bit of a mixed bag, with moments of potential that ultimately leave the viewer something different visually.Rating: 3/10.","3","15 February 2024"
"Skruffbagg","Cannon, is that you in disguise?I firmly believe Madame Web will go down in history as not only the worst superhero movie, but also one of the worst movies ever made. It's that bad. It's absolutely fascinating to behold.Now, I'll be honest with you here. I only went to see this because I had heard it was an unmitigated disaster that had to be seen to be believed, and it truly does not disappoint - or massively does, depending on your viewpoint.It takes a special kind of director to get such cringe-inducing performances out of a fairly talented cast (Dakota Johnson and Tahar Rahim are both quality actors with the right script and direction), but SJ Clarkson somehow manages to wrangle the absolute worst imaginable from every single person in the film. I'll be very surprised if she ever does another feature after this.Nothing in this film works; the plot is moronic, the script seems like it was written by a teenager, the cinematography is horrendous, the aformentioned embarrassing performances, the audio editing is baffling (so much dubbing, brain-melting music choices). I'm amazed this didn't get shelved the minute the final cut was done.To me, I rate this as ""so bad it's good"" as I wasn't bored watching it, but most people I assume will say it's just plain bad... and it is, but very entertainingly so.If you love watching a 2hr car crash then I highly recommend this. The awfulness is mind-boggling in it's complexity, but in the best possible way. Film scholars and historians will be analysing this movie for years to come, and I hope it is talked about in the same vein as The Room in the future.An absolutely epic misfire on all levels.","1","20 February 2024"
"MiroslavKyuranov","It's astonishing to think that Sony could put out a worse product than 2022's Morbius, but boy, ""Madame Web"" manages it. It is an embarrassing mess. Talented stars wasted on probably one of the worst comic book movie ever (which nobody asked for). Filled with atrocious dialogue, awkward editing and laughable structure. It's a clunky, poorly-written, messy, and sloppy movie packed with some mediocre editing and performances.The concept is interesting on paper, but it couldn't be saved due to it's terrible execution. ""Madame Web"" simply lacked the spark it needed in nearly every dept.There is simply nothing memorable in this movie, except maybe some superhero costumes, but that doesn't redeem the fact that the movie is bad.So yeah...""Madame Web"" is yet another disappointing entry in the Sony's Spider-Less universe. It's like a love letter to an era of superhero films that people largely want to forget. The ""Pepsi"" adds are stand-out, it falls short of what could have been a decent movie in the hands of someone else twenty years ago.","4","14 February 2024"
"darrelltill","There is nothing good in this film. It's badly written - not just full of clichés but full of dialogue that is meant to sound like cliché superhero idioms yet butchered until they make no sense. It is nothing but a costume parade with players that are dead behind the eyes. You can tell that everybody involved knows it's going to be a stinker but they'd already signed on and it was too late. It would be great if this was the flop that made Disney rethink their output (I know, this is actually an SSU movie not an MCU movie, but they are all heading down the same path) but I fear it will take a few more. The solution is really simple - they need to adjust their hiring policy to include persons of talent.","1","15 February 2024"
"movieman6-413-929510","Madame Web is a new spin-off set in the Marvel Spider-Man world. This spin-off is directed, partly written and produced by S. J. Clarkson. Before this film, she directed more TV series episodes of superhero shows such as Jessica Jones and The Defenders.Cassandra Webb (Dakota Johnson) works as a paramedic in New York and learns after an accident that she has superpowers to see future possibilities. She sees that the lives of three girls are threatened by a mysterious masked man with spider-like powers.This is why she tries to protect the three girls and must convince them that their lives are really in danger. To truly protect them, they must ensure that the three listen to her and learn to work together.The story of this film has an interesting concept, but the final story and screenplay were written by five different writers. These writers do not always seem to have been on the same page, because the story sometimes seems a bit rushed or frayed. It sometimes seems as if they didn't really know what exactly to do with it, or what the film studio despised of them. The screenplay has also been rewritten many times, so the cast members could no longer always follow exactly where they were going or supposed to do with the film.Despite these messy, rushed aspects, the film remains on a familiar, predictable side for a superhero film. This can make the film seem a bit long-winded or embarrassing. The film is reminiscent of other superhero films that came out around the year 2000, but of a somewhat lesser quality.The visual effects don't always look believable either. The blue screen and CGI can be seen in the film. For some of the cast members, this was also the first time they had actually worked in a film with such visual effects. The fact that they have little or no experience with these film situations is sometimes reflected in their acting.The poor script also gives the cast members few opportunities to make something special of their roles. Dakota Johnson also seemed a bit uncomfortable during promotions of the film, or ignorant of how to properly promote this film. In the final film she tries to make the best of the role and tries to add some comedy to the role, but she doesn't always get the chance to do this. Sydney Sweeney, Isabela Merced and Celeste O'Connor play the three girls Cassandra tries to protect. All three are given a little time to give their characters some personalities, but unfortunately not enough to make you as a viewer really care about the three. For a better focused film, they might have been better off using a character in the story, who Cassandra then has to protect. Tahar Rahim plays the villain in the film, who tries to kill the three girls, but also deals with the poor, weak script. As a result, he does not emerge as strongly as the villain of the story. They also didn't incorporate his audio work well into the film, because his lips sometimes don't always match what his character is saying.With all these superhero spin-off films from the Sony film studio, they only make Marvel's current film series more messy. If Sony and Disney Marvel try to collaborate on the same film series, they will have to consult each other more and better and plan where they want to go with this film series.","2","17 February 2024"
"ethanbresnett","Based on Madame Web's woeful reviews I was expecting this film to be an utter car crash. To its credit I will say it isn't entirely without merit, but it is incredibly boring and bland.Mostly this is because nothing particularly happens. It's a superhero movie with little to no superhero action and a painfully long set up for an underwhelming final act. The characters are so underdeveloped that there is no emotional connection or investment in any of them. Everything about the story and writing just feels lazy, vacuous and corny.Then there's the villain who is utterly uninspiring. He is constantly complaining about 'everything he has built' being destroyed. What has he built you might ask? The film has no interest in exploring this question. He's easily one of the more two dimensional and weak superhero villains I've ever seen committed to screen.Perhaps the most heinous crime this movie commits is to waste the talents of Dakota Johnson, Sydney Sweeney, Adam Scott, Emma Roberts, Zosia Mamet and more. Such a good cast was assembled and they were given absolutely nothing to work with, so I don't blame the performers. It's just such a shame to see such great talent put to the sword like this.As if all of this wasn't enough, the movie also feels remarkably low budget and feels excruciatingly long despite its relatively short runtime.Ultimately I think this film suffered because it was clearly intended as a set up for a wider Spider-Woman franchise which is unlikely to come to fruition. There seemed to be no interest in making a good stand alone movie, and no respect for the audience. A massive waste of time.","3","21 February 2024"
"vfphvnpp","I understand what the plan was here. They wanted a trippy film, focusing on a strong future for the Sony verse. The problem is the delivery. The camera work in this movie made it quite irritating to follow, as there was constant quick close up shots of the action. The dialogue was awful, and there was quite a lot of blatant voice over during the villain scenes.So much wasted time was given to boring scenes in the movie, which led me to believe the screen writers finished the script and realised that it was under the word count.Honestly the acting quality was quite poor across the board, especially the villain, who honestly seems as if they didn't cast for his role at all, just picked up someone off the side of the road.For someone who's guilty pleasure is watching bad movies, I it was a painful time. Don't recommend.","2","14 February 2024"
"jtorch-11283","Don't waste your time, and money seeing this in theaters. I was fooled by the trailer which looked promising. All the action in the whole film ( a total of 2 scenes) is shown in the the trailer. The rest of the movie is just terrible acting trying to save an even worse scrip.I'm honestly not sure how this made it to the big screen. I'm not a cinema expert, but shouldn't someone have to view the finished product and give the O. K. At some point before it is ""audience ready?"" I feel like that step in the process was skipped. I don't know what Marvel had to do with this film, but it certainly isn't the Iron-Man-Marvel I keep hoping they will somehow revive.And to whom it may concern, ""my parents don't love me."" Is neither a solid backstory OR a strong character trait. I hope you eat a lot of money on this movie.","1","15 February 2024"
"cosby_don","I don't know where to start-actually, I do! THIS IS THE WORST MOVIE IN THE HISTORY OF HUMANITY. I'm not kidding.I'm not sure what other movie this Dakota Johnson has been in, but after watching THIS movie, I'll probably never support her again. This was an absolute career killer. Ms. Johnson, please FIRE your agent immediately.To the production crew, editors, director, and ESPECIALLY the writers (I counted 4 writers-that's RIDICULOUS), shame on you for contributing to this mess. It's obvious you've traded in your morals for a paycheck. That's Hollywood for ya'.Did I mention that this movie was HORRENDOUSLY bad? Everything about this movie was bad-there are ZERO redeeming qualities.The story: STUPID. Worst I've ever seen, seriously. Madam Web ask the girls to wait for 3 hours in the woods? STUPID. The guy partner keeping the girls as Madam Web flies to Peru to check something out. STUPID. Madam a Web getting her powers from a spider bite through her mother. STUPID. I could seriously go on and on. I'm not kidding-EVERYTHING in this movie was STUPID. I can't count how many times I shook my head and said ""This is so bad.""The acting? Very wooden. Ms. Dakota Johnson's acting chops were the worst of the worst here. I really pray that she's done work much better. The other girls-they tried. Jokes fell flat, and they said the DUMBEST lines ever in a movie. I was seriously angry at how dumb they were.The villain? The most generic, uninteresting, uncool villain over ever seen on film. Not one memorable quote. Come to think, did he even make a ""evil guy"" speech? Nope!The ending? Oh my, HORRENDOUS. She's smiling in her glasses while paralyzed in a wheel chair? MAN WHI WROTE THIS MESS??The girls weren't even in costume more than 2 minutes of the entire film, even though in the trailer we came to expect them to be crime fighters and kicking butt in the film. WTF!Sydney Sweeney. You're good looking. Please do not EVER put out junk like this again!","1","15 February 2024"
"rgkarim","LIKES:The Commentary At Times
-Some lines in this movie are startling at how funny they were for me, a fantastic bout of teenage emotions with a less than thrilled babysitter.-Madame Web's origin story is almost like an anti-hero tale to Charles Xavier idea, and though it's not fully fleshed out, there is emotion, fun, and what felt natural angst and vulnerability into it.-With the right timing, and build up, this section of commentary was a striking positive in this reviewers book.Representation of Paramedics
-It's a rare thing to get to actually see E. M. T's in their work and what they give to serve the public.-While a bit forced, and perhaps a tad overdone and cheesy, kudos for Madame Web accomplishing some detailed shots of them serving the public and giving a little character development with it.-There were great avenues taken to help ingrain parts into the story, and with that, the medical nerd inside me found a cool little nod in those sequences.Some Artistic Visuals Are Cool
-I'm a sucker for a good shot and a good artistic visual popping out and ingraining itself into my mind.-Madame Web has some of these moments for me, the creepy and yet serene world of the Web World, being one that holds majesty and mystery, but also the very emotions of the person trying to wield it.-Other shots of costume crusaders striking that right pose, or perhaps that nostalgic early 2000s look, really help establish some of the themes of the movie or a good set up visual to cascade into.-It may be sprinkled about, but there were some superhero visuals that accomplished the job for me in Madame Web.Talented Cast
-Celeste O'Connor is very fun in this movie. A tad quirky, but she keeps the attitude going, a lot of that sass very fun and usually well-placed to help move the story towards forced comedy and obvious story telling.-Merced eventually grew on me after she got into the meat of her character and starting to push past the stubborn and cheeky attitude. She's got charming charisma, a fun brainy side to exploit, and this sadness that she uses to illicit such emotion, something I wanted more of, but got only little.-Sweeney is fun in this movie. Toned down from the other roles I've seen, the woman knows how to adapt her style and give me something to hook to several times. I love the awkwardness she brings, the tie in to the two extremes, and her surprising smallness after she plays such big roles.-And Johnson is about the same as she always is. A snarky and condescending nature that she wields expertly, but a tad dry at times that some lines feel unfulfilled. Fortunately, she's got good chemistry with the girls that assisted in smoothing out the faults.Some Surprising Character Arcs
-The movie may miss a lot of things, but there are a few moments that work very well to show the potential of Madame Web if given the right focus.-An opening that holds some merit was one of the victories, something that would eventually bleed into plot points further on that gave you a very touching moment.-And another element has the other's origin stories granting us some potential hurt and relatable tales to latch onto and acknowledge. Again, helping give a young and in your face Charlie's Angel group some vim and vigor.The Music
-Call me a sucker for nostalgia, Madame Web has a mix of songs that were perfect for viewers like me to enjoy.-Comedic use of the songs are not the most creative, but add that minor element to help give the girls a little more dynamic and believability.-While other times, it's just a blast of the speakers and me dancing in my seat as the forgotten wonder returns for another run to get things started.DISLIKES:The Pacing Uneven
-Despite the trinkets and some merits to the story, Madame Web's dislikes for me start with the pacing of the tale.-A moderately slow start did little to keep me engaged, only to then have these sprints of faster moments to try to change things up, before hitting the brakes again.-Like a CW season crammed into one, Madame Web's pacing feels a lot like dressed up teenage drama trying to give realism and gradual steps, but really just being the mashup of the uglier time use dramas can get stuck to.The Stale Mechanic
-From the trailers, you know there is some type of vision gimmick that Cassie is supposed to use to protect her charges.-That gimmick gets stale very quickly for a viewer like me, the convoluted presentation starting out fun at first, but then turning into annoying déjà vu that felt more like reshoots than actual artistic twisting.-Like Moon Knight, that element makes sense at first, but really could have stopped halfway through the movie once the viewers has connected the powers.-Had there been a bit more excitement, fighting, or even better storytelling to distract, it would have been less impactful, but alas, for me, all the other limitations added up.Lack of Other Character Development
-There are a lot of characters in this movie, some played by bigger names than the leads themselves. And yet, their time and character development felt shoehorned than planned out.-Adam Scott and Emma Roberts seem disengaged, with stories that are cliché, simplistic, and a waste of talent that again showed potential with that slower pacing at the start.-But even the villain and main girls tales feel very bland, and that lack of character development was very much felt by me that it almost seems to rely heavily on another movie to do these characters justice.Annoying Dialogue
-I know, I said the commentary was good, but that was a small amount of it compared to the whole.-Madame Web's dialogue seems to have gone through the writing grinder several times, very loaded with one liners, sassy comments and attitude that seemed to be out of place for much of the film for me.-Statements of the obvious, corny dialogue essentially pushed in with too simplistic of writing and in your face, overdramatic flair to count as quality dialogue. It needs tuning up, needs to be less forceful, and try to add a little Hollywood magic to help tenderize it to something matching a comic book movie.A Villain Needing A Lot More
-Don't get me wrong, there is an element to him that is relatable, believable, and indeed threatening in terms of the madness of his actions.-But outside of this and the opening scene, Ezekiel is a very bland bad guy who just didn't get the time to shine outside of crawling and repeating the same lines over and over.-The direction failed to give him any recognizable skills, his threats empty most of the time and sort of creepy obsessive, and dare I say his actual character is zoomed over and practically absent but for the opening line.-To me, that's a limited villain and one major flaw that much of the movie suffers from.Visuals Get Really Muddy/Bad
-Sony makes such great looking video games, and yet their movies still suffer from last gen effects
-While the artistic flair of those moments was enjoyable, they did have that faux effect that dropped some of the realism this movie was going for.-Even worse, there are lots of movements, character renderings, and powers that leave a lot to be desired in looking their best. I won't say it's a dealbreaker, but it doesn't help to have such limited technology presentation.Scenes/Story Seem Very Chopped Up
-Between the gimmicks and pacing, the scenes already feel limited, messy, and almost like an abbreviated version of what they could be.-Sure, the dialogue gives you everything they are going for, but the presentation felt very much like a lot of reshoots of the same scene, and slight changes that made little difference.-Such indecisive direction and edits got away from them and left me just wondering what this film could have been with half the gimmicks of the visions pulled back.The Action Is Very Boring
-No denying this, Madame Web maybe even worse than many of the CW attempts at action.-While witty, and an amusing game of cat and mouse, a Spiderverse without a solid one or two fights is a verse I'm not fond playing in for nearly two hours.-A lame villain does little but strut and crawl, while our cast somehow running away and eluding comes off a bit pathetic than entertaining.-Even the climax is a mess, rushed finishes, suspense of disbelief, and an overdramatic battle of words with a very extravagant and mushy ending to cap it off.-Eternals at least had a few moves that had me rocking in my seat, but this... this was a challenge to stay awake in.The VERDICT:
Madame Web is certainly not the worst movie I've seen in years, but that doesn't mean Sony's latest is a masterpiece either. There are elements of this vision that show the potential for a good future, but need a lot of work to make up for this rushed installment. A talented cast, music and some fun writing can be the starting building blocks, but it can't offset what feels like lots of production limitations, rewrites, and editing that greatly show in this movie. Boring battles, annoying gimmicks, and under developed characters despite a strong cast were just some of the limitations this movie has to work through if a series is to come with it. Should one see it in theaters? Not really. A shot at home, I would say sure, but with all of this, my scores for the movie are:Action/Adventure/Sci-Fi: 6.0
Movie Overall: 5.0.","5","15 February 2024"
"eddie_baggins","I'm not ashamed to admit I've seen some movies in my time.I am however ashamed to admit curiosity got the better of me and I ended up in an almost entirely empty cinema screening (thanks to one tolerant movie buddy who joined me on my trip to the local cinema) partaking in what can only be described as one of the most universally panned Hollywood blockbusters of the modern era.Not at all interested in watching another Sony Marvel outing after their last few efforts, hearing about the insanely awesome awfulness of Madame Web from friends, internet identities and esteemed critics made me want to witness a potential all-time cringe-fest and while when people are absolutely right in their hyperbole around just how bad Madame Web is, I'm still trying to comprehend how I could possibly testify to just how bad things are here.Directed by long time TV episode director S. J. Clarkson and featuring a cast of performers who have all proven over time to be more than capable of bringing the goods, Madame Web is not devoid of talent that may have been able to salvage some type of goodness from an offence against the entire cinematic medium but as a finished? (Honestly I am unsure how anyone could claim this is an acceptable final version, just watch for some of the most flawed examples of ADR you're ever going to see) product there was no one or any thing that could've saved this nightmare from the fate it had created for itself.An experience that could only possibly come from a collective group who all gave up the fight to save it long before shooting had wrapped, Madame Web inexcusably comes from the same penmanship that was guilty of unleashing Morbius on us but screenwriters Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless at least managed to find some cult like goodness in Jared Leto and Matt Smith's wildly OTT characters and bizarre action segments but Madame Web is nothing more than two hours of terrible plot, characters, spectacle and intentions and there is quite literally no valid reason for this movie to exist in the form it has been given.One of the most atrociously acted Hollywood films ever captured, with lead Dakota Johnson unable to hold back her disdain for a film she clearly hated being a part of and poor old Tahar Rahim taking the films most unfortunate mantle from a wigged Sydney Sweeney, Madame Web may have been promoted as some type of intense action thriller following the exploits of Johnson's Cassandra Webb as she battles Rahim's Ezekiel Sims alongside Sweeney's Julia, Isabela Merced's Anya and Celeste O'Connor's Mattie but we get something else entirely that is hard to come to terms with.From some of the most detestable and frequent examples of product placement that becomes instantly iconic (some viewers may find themselves attempting to crack open a Pepsi can in their Calvin Klein's after a viewing), a villain we literally know nothing about with zero attempts to bother explaining his plans or background, an embarrassing use of comic staple characters that aren't even put into action outside of dream sequences and a script that must surely have been conjured on ChatGPT, Madame Web is a cesspool of Hollywood excrement that isn't even funny in its horribleness, just merely sad and depressing.The only justifiable reason for Madame Web to be the film it is as it stands is if Sony are deliberately attempting to sabotage their Marvel property that no longer is allowed to include many fan favourites, if they aren't in fact doing that there is zero excuses for why Madame Web has ever been allowed to be birthed into existence.An irredeemable, amateurish and embarrassing exercise in pointless, Madame Web is a shockingly bad example of blockbuster filmmaking that is the exact type of bottom feeder product the cinema industry and the Marvel brand didn't need at this particular point of time.Final Say -If you're a glutton for punishment and want to be reminded of everything you wouldn't wish to see in a supposed piece of big screen entertainment then Madame Web is for you! A truly iconic new addition to the staples of all-time misfires, nothing could prepare one for the garbage that is this $80 million dollar disasterpiece.0 fireworks to the head out of 5.Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)","1","22 February 2024"
"shaikhirshad-41223","Literally I had zero expectations when I went to watch this flick but I still thought that something should be good in this to watch at least one time because of marvel name in it. But this movie is so low and looks like low budget CGI thriller and a comedy in the name of superhero genre.I mean from the start itself movie lost it's pace and story and god only knows what are they showing no interest in the screenplay and the plot is not even engaging to watch for at least 30 mins.I only went for Dakota & Sydney just because the screen presence of them looks good, but the director loss this opportunity too. Because the character they're playing is so bad and not even proper dialogues are given and just they have made a common character with no story arc just the situation that they have to act
I've never seen such a bad cinematography of any film it looks like they don't have any interest making this film so they just made a spoof just to show that we are making a movie. Don't know what to say more because this film is that bad.Overall a Boring fest and a spoof fo a superhero genre.","2","16 February 2024"
"vengeance20","Ok, so before people come at me with the ""YoU dIdN't LiKe It BeCaUsE iT wAs FeMaLe LeAd."" chestnut. I went into this one with an open mind, but expecting it to be as described & the reviews were right. The film is bad.The film sees Cassandra Webb who is a New York metropolis paramedic who begins to demonstrate signs of clairvoyance. Forced to challenge revelations about her past, she needs to safeguard 3 young girls from a deadly adversary who wants them destroyed.I found the film to be pretty bad. It's disjointed, clunky, poorly paced & just feels very awkward & stiff. The characters are personality-less, they look & sound as if they're reciting their lines from cue cards (almost robotic, I might add) & the script reads like a supermarket shopping receipt.The films story is all over the place, confusing & hard to follow. The premonition sequences the main lead experiences were annoying & while creative, were repetitive to the point where you couldn't tell if she was hallucinating or actually seeing what she was seeing.The films runtime is overly long for what it is, while not as bad as other films which are generally over 2 hours (rolls eyes), this film felt longer & as I said was too long for what it was at 1 hour & 48 minutes (108 minutes) without credits & the pacing, jeez... don't get me started.The actors were alright, but what they were given script wise, didn't work & made them come across as flat. There's some action & not bad effects to be had, but that's pretty much the only redeeming features from this flick, sadly. It hasn't a lot going for it & is pretty lack luster & basic.Don't get me wrong, I prefer films with straight forward story-lines & plots you can follow, but this one was a bit too basic & could've used more meatiness to beef it up more as well as more emphasis to keep the audience engaged with the story, characters, action etc.I generally didn't like the film & the ending is just out there too & is pretty cringy like some of the scenes in the film as well as the few cringy action sequences themselves among some of the good action we got.Overall, it's a bad film. And no, it's got nothing to do with the old chestnut of me being a man who doesn't like the film because it's female lead. The film was bad & had plenty of things wrong with it. People in general, men & women, boys & girls, didn't like this flick.The story is bland, boring & paper thin like the characters & leads, the little bit of good action & effects seen are overshadowed by the aforementioned issues as well as the other issues like the poor runtime, pacing & the lacking engagement the film has.Also, for those who can't seem to get it in their heads, there's been plenty of female lead films in the past that have done well, from the Alien Franchise to The Hunger Games along with Elektra, Tomb Raider, Salt, Lucy, Hanna etc. I could go on but that's my rant for those who need calling out.2/10.","2","20 February 2024"

"alindsayal","With Marvel Studios taking on more responsibility involving Spider-Man, Sony have decided to try and build a universe involving smaller characters from the same lore as him. We have had Venom and Morbius and will get Kraven The Hunter later this year but here we have Madame Web. I saw this film last night and here is my review for Madame Web. The p[remise of the film sees a women bestowed with powers where she has to save 3 girls from being killed by a villainous foe.Main Character
I must be honest that I have never been a huge fan of Dakota Johnson and she plays Cassandra Web here and I have to be honest she isn't particularly good here. She is overacting everything here and her character is super unlikeable and hard to care about. She is clearly hampered by the awful writing in this film and she can't rise above it and give us a lead role to support or care about and Cassie Web will go down as one of the worst leads in a comic book film ever.Supporting Characters
Sydney Sweeney, Isabela Merced & Celeste O'Connor play the three girls that are in the view of the villain and they are all pretty awful. Their characters are really awkward and not particularly likeable, the film tries to force you to like and care about these characters but it comes across poorly and these actresses aren't good enough to make me care.Tahar Rahim plays Ezekiel Sims and he is one of the more frustrating parts of this film because I have seen him be a good actor and this character had some potential but the film really flops here and makes him this over the top villain that is so stupid that it really takes you out of the film.Adam Scott as Ben Parker is probably the best person here but he isn't really given much to do and it still upsets me that he plays Ben Parker and it is really clear that this was just done to provide some stupid fan service that actually annoys me even more.Story
The story is nonsensical and completely stupid. The plot makes no sense and characters do things that make no sense, Cassie Web in particular is one of the dumbest characters that I have seen in recent movies. This film also tries its best to ruin the character of Spider-Man even though he isn't in the film and it is just the backdrop to this pretty dull and horrendous adventure.Script
This is a really awfully written film. Things make no sense, characters are unlikeable and there is no humour here at all. There are so many plot holes it is crazy and the film has nothing interesting about it at all.Style
I mean I guess the action scenes are okay and the bad guys suit was okay but that is it. The film is filmed really poorly, the editing looks unfinished and at times it is actually quite jarring to watch it. There are way too many jump scares especially for a film that is not a horror film. The trailer shows things that barely happen in the film and it feels like we were sold a different film that never got made.Overall
Overall, Madame Web is a truly disastrous film. This is up there with one of the worst films I have ever seen and is up there with the worst comic book films of all time. Though I am glad I saw this film to have this experience but at all cost avoid this garbage and do something better for 2 hours.Rating - 1/10.","1","16 February 2024"
"daisukereds","A baby-sitting movie in a Superhero setting, where the lead can see the future and has to prevent NOT-Spiderman from killing teenagers (because he has dreams/visions about them). The girls run and hide around a lot, some BS happens and then the movie ends.The foundation of the script is heavily written around a hollow core of ""parents and children"". The cinematography is actually good, and at least ""teaches"" how to do CPR. It also does away with showing premonitions every time something is to be changed near the end.. respecting the viewers intelligence in at least that aspect! And it's easy to follow (if you don't fall asleep) with how simplistic it is.Aside from that, it is barely anything else..
The movie itself isn't terrible.. it's just beyond bland and boring. Also, calling this a Superhero movie is really disingenuous and a marketing ploy to get people to see it. Stay home! There are no good action sequences and nobody is written memorably....
Venom making money was a mistake. Sony has half a franchise, and they can't get anyone talented enough to do something with it. And what they continue to release seems like high-budgeted fan fiction!","3","16 February 2024"
"isaacsundaralingam","Yea, this was garbage and that's saying plenty. It's actually adorable how little anyone cared about ""Madame Web"" - not just the audience, but the filmmakers and actors themselves. Written by the same people who wrote ""Morbius"", this movie is yet another reason to not let them anywhere near a writing software ever again.Not only was the movie unwatchable due to how lifeless it was, but it was also criminally boring. You're waiting for something to happen and you keep waiting right until the credits start to roll. Nothing about the movie was compelling, the plot was riddled with plot holes, the screenplay was lazy, the dialogues were dead and the acting was almost as if the actors were held captive and being forced to act as if everything was okay. It reeks of corporate greed and there isn't a single positive thing to say about this movie.We're only a month and half into the year and we already have a very strong contender for what might be the worst movie of the year, and it's not even close. Don't watch it, but if you do indeed decide to, I hope you lived a life well enough to have a crowded funeral.","1","19 February 2024"
